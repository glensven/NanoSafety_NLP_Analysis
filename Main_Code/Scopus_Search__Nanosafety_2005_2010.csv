Printer toner is one of the largest consumables in daily office work, and the particles released from printers and photocopiers may pose damage to respiratory system. In this study, we found the particles can be released into the surrounding environment during the printing process and the concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 particles increased obviously. To evaluate the time-course pulmonary responses caused by toner particles, the toner suspension was instilled into the lungs of the male mice through intratracheally instillation every other day for four times and the pulmonary responses of the lung were monitored at days 9, 28, 56 and 84. Indeed, mice treated with toner particles displayed a slower body weight growth rate during the recovery phase. The total cell number in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) of toner-exposed groups was much higher than the saline-treated groups. The total protein, lactate dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase in BALF exhibited significant changes (p<0.05 or p<0.01) at different time points. The nitric oxide synthase, interleukin 1-beta, and interleukin 6 in the lung tissue of the toner-exposed groups also exhibited significant changes (p<0.05 or p<0.01). The pathological examination showed that toner particles can adhere to the alveolar septal walls, then enter into the alveoli and cause pulmonary lesion. During the experimental period, particles phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages (AMs) led to an increase of both AMs number and apoptosis. The pulmonary stress still remained over time even with a clearance period for 12 weeks. These results indicate that exposure to toner particles can inhibit the normal growth of the mice and induce significant inflammatory responses and lesion in the lung tissues. The health and safety effects from working indoors in offices with fumes and particles released from photocopiers and printers need to be paid more attention. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."
2010-12-14,Strategy for the modification of electrospun fibers that allows diverse functional groups for biomolecular entrapment,"A method to functionalize surfaces of electrospun (ES) fibers under relatively mild, aqueous conditions, that allows diverse functional groups for biomolecular entrapment, was reported. A well-developed biosilicification of certain marine organisms that catalyze silica acid polymerization under physiological conditions via proteins called silaffins is employed. To initiate homogeneous polymerization of silica acid on fibers, the initiator, 2-(dimethylamino) ethylmethacrylate (DMAEMA), was introduced, onto surfaces via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The results show that highly dense DMAEMA could be easily achieved to precipitate silica layer with thickness of 100 nm within 10 min. Precursors of organosilane are likely to strongly adsorb on the PDMAEMA via electrostatic interactions and polymerize to form networks to further concrete on them."
2010-12-10,Management of nanomaterials safety in research environment,"Despite numerous discussions, workshops, reviews and reports about responsible development of nanotechnology, information describing health and environmental risk of engineered nanoparticles or nanomaterials is severely lacking and thus insufficient for completing rigorous risk assessment on their use. However, since preliminary scientific evaluations indicate that there are reasonable suspicions that activities involving nanomaterials might have damaging effects on human health; the precautionary principle must be applied. Public and private institutions as well as industries have the duty to adopt preventive and protective measures proportionate to the risk intensity and the desired level of protection. In this work, we present a practical, 'user-friendly' procedure for a university-wide safety and health management of nanomaterials, developed as a multi-stakeholder effort (government, accident insurance, researchers and experts for occupational safety and health). The process starts using a schematic decision tree that allows classifying the nano laboratory into three hazard classes similar to a control banding approach (from Nano 3 - highest hazard to Nano1 - lowest hazard). Classifying laboratories into risk classes would require considering actual or potential exposure to the nanomaterial as well as statistical data on health effects of exposure. Due to the fact that these data (as well as exposure limits for each individual material) are not available, risk classes could not be determined. For each hazard level we then provide a list of required risk mitigation measures (technical, organizational and personal). The target 'users' of this safety and health methodology are researchers and safety officers. They can rapidly access the precautionary hazard class of their activities and the corresponding adequate safety and health measures. We succeed in convincing scientist dealing with nano-activities that adequate safety measures and management are promoting innovation and discoveries by ensuring them a safe environment even in the case of very novel products. The proposed measures are not considered as constraints but as a support to their research. This methodology is being implemented at the Ecole Polytechnique de Lausanne in over 100 research labs dealing with nanomaterials. It is our opinion that it would be useful to other research and academia institutions as well. © 2010 Groso et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

The model employs a microfluidic system and poly(ethylene glycol)-terminated oxysilane (PEG-oxysilane) to modify glass surfaces in order to resist cell adhesion. The system allows the selective confinement of different types of cells to realize complete confinement, partial confinement, and no confinement of three types of cells on glass surfaces.

In the present study, sol-gel driven nickel ferrite (NiFe2O 4) and cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) nanoparticles (10-25 nm) at different concentrations were incorporated into biodegradable polymer, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), using oil-in-oil emulsion/solvent evaporation technique, and then the cytotoxicity of magnetic nanocomposite spheres was characterized using raw cells. The test provides the toxicity of the products prior to their real applications, which may limit animal experimentation, remove potential toxic compounds and reduce the downstream costs. The cytotoxicity results showed that both magnetic nanocomposite spheres were toxic at some degree to the raw cells; however, the cobalt ferrite nanoparticles in nanocomposite spheres are more toxic than the nickel ferrite nanoparticles.

The microbubble explosion may produce shock wave which is in-phase detected by a low-frequency piezoelectric transducer. The effects of particle size and category on the threshold laser fluence of shock wave generation and the wave intensity are investigated.

2010-12-01,Effects of copper nanoparticles on the development of zebrafish embryos,"The environmental behavior and the potential toxicity of copper nanoparticles (nano-Cu) in water are major concerns for assessing their environmental safety. The present study was undertaken to characterize the properties of nano-Cu in E3 medium, such as size changes, solubility, zeta-potential and pH, and to test the toxicity of nano-Cu suspension to zebrafish embryos. Dynamic light scattering and solubility experiments showed that three components coexisted in the nano-Cu exposure system, including small nano-Cu aggregates still suspended in E3 medium, large nano-Cu aggregates deposited on the container bottom and dissolved copper species (Cu (dis)). Both the zeta-potential of nano-Cu particles in E3 medium and the pH of the nano-Cu suspension showed no change during a 24 hour period. It is found that nano-Cu retarded the hatching of zebrafish embryos and caused morphological malformation of the larvae, and high concentrations (>0.1 mg/L) of nano-Cu even killed the gastrula-stage zebrafish embryos. Cu 2+ ions were used to study the toxicity caused by nano-Cu dissolution. The embryo toxicity of nano-Cu at 0.01 and 0.05 mg/L showed no significant difference from Cu 2+ at the corresponding concentrations (0.006 and 0.03 mg/L), but 0.1 mg/L nano-Cu had a greater toxicity than 0.06 mg/L Cu 2+.

2010-12-01,Surface modification induced shielding effects on electron orbital coupling in metallofullerene,"The electronic properties of four metallofullerenol samples (La@C 82(OH) 32, La@C 82(OH) 24, La@C 82(OH) 18, La@C 82(OH) 12) and La@C 82 were investigated by synchrotron radiation photo-electron emission spectra (PES). A new emission peak with binding energy of 13.9 eV, which is attributed to La 5d orbitals coupling with nanocage orbitals, is observed in PES of La@C 82 for the first time. This suggestion is also supported by previous DFT calculations. Furthermore, the new emission peak disappears when the surface of La@C 82 is modified with specific numbers of OH groups, which means the electron orbital coupling between inner metallic atoms and outer nanocage in metallofullerene could be shielded by surface modifications on the outer nanocage.

2010-12-01,Subcellular distribution of polyhydroxylated metallofullerene Gd@C <inf>82</inf>(OH) <inf>22</inf> in different tissues of tumor-bearing mice,"Endohedral metallofullerenes have unique chemical and physical properties that are essential for biomedical applications. They can be used as a radiotracer in magnetic resonance and X-ray imaging (MRI and XRI). Polyhydroxylated metallofullerene Gd@C 82(OH) x has been studied as a new high efficient contrast agents for MRI and has also shown high efficiency for antitumor growth. Previous studies have shown that Gd@C 82(OH) 22 mainly accumulated in bone, pancreas, liver and kidney after intraperitoneal administration. However, whether the nanoparticles can enter into cells and the site of their potential action remains unclear. In this work, the distribution patterns of Gd@C 82(OH) 22 in subcellular compartments were studied using the techniques of differential centrifugation and ICP-MS analysis. The results indicate that the Gd@C 82(OH) 22 can enter into cells and the subcellular distribution patterns are significantly different from that of GdCl 3. GdCl 3 has much higher bioavailability for mice than Gd@C 82(OH) 22. Therefore, the present data suggest that Gd@C 82(OH) 22 in living systems may be not decomposed to release free Gd 3+ ion and may be metabolized as a pristine carbon cage.

2010-12-01,Ag nanoparticles coated SWCNT with surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signals,"We report here a simple method to fabricate the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) coated DNA-SWCNTs that give SERS signals. Dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) suggested the products are dispersive and soluble in aqueous solution. The Raman scattering spectra show AgNPs coated SWCNTs have enhanced the Raman signal when compared with pure SWCNT. From the radial breathing mode (RBM) of the Raman spectra, we can disclose that this DNA-SWCNT has unique chirality, which implies that it could be a good nanoprobe for cell marking.

2010-12-01,Cytotoxicity of zinc oxide nanoparticles: Importance of microenvironment,"While ZnO particles are widely used in many fields, including personal care products, the high toxicity of ZnO nanoparticles has been reported and aroused great health concerns. In this study, the cytotoxicity of ZnO nanoparticles was evaluated and, in particular, the role of microenvironment in their toxicity was investigated. Our results show that ZnO nanoparticles are highly toxic to NIH/3T3 cells, inducing viability loss, membrane leakage and morphology changes. The microenviroment, here the C0 2 atmosphere under cell culture condition, promoted the solubilization of ZnO nanoparticles. Then the released Zn from ZnO nanoparticles induces the cytotoxicity. The importance of microenvironment on the ZnO nanotoxicity is presented and the implications to future nanotoxicology studies are discussed. Copyright © 2010 American Scientific Publishers."
2010-12-01,Modulation of oxidative stress by functionalized fullerene materials in the lung tissues of female C57/BL mice with a metastatic Lewis lung carcinoma,"Oxidative stress is considered to be one of the important mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis. To investigate the effect of [Gd@C 82(OH) 22] n and [C 60(OH) 20] n nanoparticles on the oxidative stress in the tumor-bearing mice, several antioxidative enzymes and antioxidants were tested for mice with or without tumor inoculation. Transplanted tumors were grown in mice by subcutaneous inoculation of a metastatic Lewis lung carcinoma in female C57/BL mice. More importantly, the tumor cells can metastasize into the normal lung tissues gradually. Therefore, in present paper, the activities of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione S-transferase (GST), as well as the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the tumor-invaded lung tissues of the tumor-bearing mice were compared to the nomal lung tissues of normal mice. After treatment with nanoparticles, the activities of GSH-Px and GST and other parameters related to the oxidative stress were downregulated and tended closely to the normal levels. Pulmonary histopathological results also showed that two different types of water-soluble fullerenes can prevent lungs from inflammatory lesion and tumor invasion. These findings indicate two different types of water-soluble fullerenes materials can downregulate the oxidative stress status by scavenging excessive free radicals and inhibiting the lipid peroxidation in tumor-bearing mice, which can partly explain their protective roles on the pulmonary oxidative-damage induced by the tumor metastasis to lung tissues.

2010-12-01,Biomedical activities of endohedral metallofullerene optimized for nanopharmaceutics,"Endohedral metallofullerenes, a novel form of carbon-related nanomaterials, currently attract wide attention for their potential applications in biomedical fields such as therapeutic medicine. Most endohedral metallofullerenes are synthesized using C 60 or higher molecular weight fullerenes because of the limited interior volume of fullerene. It is known that the encapsulated metal atom has strong electronic interactions with the carbon cage in metallofullerenes. Gd@C 82 is one of the most important molecules in the metallofullerene family, known as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast agent candidate for diagnostic imaging. Gadolinium endohedral metallofullerenol (e.g., Gd@C 82(OH) 22) is a functionalized fullerene with gadolinium trapped inside carbon cage. Our group previously demonstrated that the distinctive chemical and physical properties of Gd@C 82(OH) 22 are dependent on the number and position of the hydroxyl groups on the fullerene cage. The present article summarizes our latest findings of biomedical effects of Gd@C 82(OH) 22 and gives rise to a connected flow of the existing knowledge and information from experts in the field. It briefly narrates the synthesis and physico-chemical properties of Gd@C 82(OH) 22. The polyhydroxylated nanoparticles exhibit the enhanced water solubility and high purity, and were tested as a MRI contrast agent. Gd@C 82(OH) 22 treatment inhibited tumor growth in tumor-bearing nude mice. Although the precise mechanisms of this action are not well defined, our in vitro data suggest involvements of improved immunity and antioxidation by Gd@C 82(OH) 22 and its size-based selective targeting to tumor site. The review critically analyzed the relevant data instead of fact-listing, and explained the potential for developing Gd@C 82(OH) 22 into a diagnostic or therapeutic agent.

2010-12-01,In vitro cytotoxicity of transparent yellow iron oxide nanoparticles on human glioma cells,"With rapid development of nanotechnology, concerns about the possible adverse health effects on human beings by using nanomaterials have been raised. Transparent yellow iron oxide (α-FeOOH) nanoparticles have been widely used in paints, plastic, rubber, building materials, papermaking, food products and pharmaceutical industry, thus the potential health implications by the exposure should be considered. The purpose of this study is to assess the cytotoxicity of transparent yellow iron oxide nanoparticles on U251 human glioma cells. The α-FeOOH nanoparticles are in clubbed shapes with 9 nm in diameter and 43 nm long. The specific surface area is 115.3 m 2/g. After physicochemical characterization of the nanoparticles, U251 cells were exposed to α-FeOOH at the doses of 0, 3.75, 15, 60 and 120 (μg/mL. The results showed that the α-FeOOH nanoparticles reduced the cell viability and induced necrosis and apoptosis in U251 cells. In addition, nanoparticle exposure significantly increased the levels of superoxide anion and nitric oxide in a dose-dependent fashion in the cells. Our results suggest that exposure to α-FeOOH nanoparticles induce significant free radical formation and cytotoxic effects. The large surface area that induced high surface reactivity may play an important role in the cytotoxic effect of α-FeOOH nanoparticles. Copyright © 2010 American Scientific Publishers."
2010-12-01,Oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by iron oxide nanoparticles in cultured human umbilical endothelial cells,"Recent epidemiologic researches indicate that exposure to ultrafine particles (nanoparticles) is an independent risk factor for several cardiovascular diseases. The induction of endothelial injuries is hypothesized to be an attractive mechanism involved in these cardiovascular diseases. To investigate this hypothesis, the widely used iron nanomaterials, ferric oxide (Fe 2O 3) and ferriferrous oxide (Fe 3O 4) nanoparticles were incubated with human umbilical endothelial cells (ECV304 cells) at different concentrations of 2, 20, 100 μg/mL. The cell viability, the rate of apoptosis, the apoptotic nuclear morphology and the mitochondria membrane potential were measured to estimate the cell necrosis and apoptosis caused by the nanoparticle exposure. The stimulation of superoxide anion (O 2·-) and nitric oxide (NO) were examined to evaluate the stress responses of endothelial cells. Our results indicated that both the Fe 2O 3 and Fe 3O 4 nanoparticles could generate oxidative stress as well as the significant increase of nitric oxide in ECV304 cells. The loss of mitochondria membrane potential and the apoptotic chromatin condensation in the nucleus were observed as the early signs of apoptosis. It is inferred the stress response might be an important mechanism involving in endothelial cells apoptosis and death, and these injuries in endothelial cells might play a key role in downstream cardiovascular diseases such as atheroscelerosis, hypertension and myocardial infarction (MI).

2010-12-01,Transmembrane delivery of aggregated [Gd@C <inf>82</inf>(OH) <inf>22</inf>] <inf>n</inf> nanoparticles,"We investigated whether multi-hydroxyl metallofullerenes can penetrate into erythrocyte and whether this potential transmembrane delivery requires aggregated nanostructure of these particles. The metal atom encapsulated in metallofullerenes was used as a quantitative marker to investigate body distribution of aggregated nanoparticles in cytomembrane and cytoplasm. Image of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and assay of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) suggested that aggregated [Gd@C 82(OH) 22] n particles traversed through cytomembrane into cytoplasm. Aggregated Gd nanostructure belonged to small sphere with average diameter of 22.4 ±0.5 nm. For pristine Gd@C 82 molecule, due to the electron donation from Gd atom, the distribution of electrons on the surface of carbon cage was localized. The electrophilic additive reaction of polyhydroxyl on the surface of Gd@C 82 was directly affected by local distribution of electrons. This resulted in local distribution of hydroxyls on the surface of Gd nanoparticles. Local distribution of hydroxyls brought about polar and nonpolar domains on particle surface, which induced Gd@C 82(OH) 22 to be amphiphilic molecule with due hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. Amphiphilic properties of these molecules promoted their mutual aggregation in water. In the process of aggregation, amphiphilic properties of aggregated nanoparticles were well maintained, and besides, hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains were also regularly distributed on the surface of [Gd@C 82(OH) 22] n particles. The amphiphilic nanoparticles attached externally to cytomembrane of erythrocyte might be effectively driven by hydrophobic effect when they directly contacted cytomembrane of erythrocyte. The number of [Gd@C 82(OH) 22] n nanoparticles attached to cytomembrane reached up to a certain critical threshold, a significant curvature tension of membrane would occur. The shape of cell was accordingly changed. Increased membrane tension triggered the sudden opening of specific pores as a result of cytmembrane response to nanoparitcle effect and the [Gd@C 82(OH) 22] n nanoparticles gained entry to cell via these pores. This process was biologically independent of caveolar-mediated endocytosis or transportation pathway via ion channels. Copyright © 2010 American Scientific Publishers."

We investigate these particles from the viewpoint of nanosafety (penetration into skin in vivo, production of free radicals when UV-irradiated) as well as UV protection. We show that: a) even after multiple applications, the particles remain within stratum corneum (uppermost skin layer); b) the optimal sizes are 62 nm and 45 nm, respectively for TiO2 and ZnO particles for 310-nm light and, correspondingly, 122 and 140 nm - for 400-nm radiation; c) in general, small particles (25 nm in diameter) are more photoactive than the larger ones (400 nm in diameter); however, on the background if porcine skin in vitro this difference is not seen and is substantially surpassed by skin contribution into production of free radicals. © 2010 SPIE."

The mechanism is the abstraction of thiols by Hg2+ that led to the aggregation of nanoparticles. With the assistance of solar light irradiation, the detection limit can be as low as 30 nM, which satisfies the guideline concentration of Hg2+ in drinking water set by the WHO. In addition, the dynamic range of detection is wide (3 × 10-8 -1 × 10-2 M).

2010-11-09,Nanomaterials Optimized to improve delivery efficiency for gene therapy,"Polycationic nanoparticles are potential as polycationic nonviral vectors (polyplexes) to overcome the defects of traditional viral vectors. The low transfection efficiency in vivo was attributed to poor circulation of polyplexes with high residual positive charges on the surface, which cause them susceptible to agglomerate with negatively charged serum components and to be scavenged by macrophages, whereas, the positive charges are likewise beneficial polyplexes to interact with negative-charged plasma membranes of targeted cells and specifically increase intracellular transfection efficiency of polyplexes. Numerous studies focused on revealing the relationship between the structure of polycationic vectors and the transfection efficiency in vivo. The designed polyplexes in our group to extend nanoparticles circulation is possible to overcome other barriers including endosome escape, cytoplasmic transport and nuclear entry for ultimately successful gene transfection in vivo. Polyplexes circulation was prolonged by modifying with polycations such as PEIs, PDMAEMA, chitosan et al. It was found that PEGylation of polyplexes could improve the stability of polyplexes in vivo but dramatically decrease therapeutic efficiency due to reduced transfection. In addition, the strong hydrophilicity of the PEG segments could dissociate PEGylated polyplexes under the physiological environment and attenuate polycation carrying with target genes. polycationic nonviral gene delivery vectors in order to improve the circulation time and transfection efficiency in vivo for efficient gene therapyin order to improve the circulation time. Polyplexes might be potential to be alternative nonviral gene delivery vectors for efficient clinical therapy."

Undesired bubble accumulation in microfluidic channels abruptly changes the microenvironment of adherent cells and leads to the damage and death of cells. Existing bubble trapping approaches have drawbacks such as the need to pause fluid flow, requirement for external vacuum or pressure source, and possible cytotoxicity. This study reports two kinds of integrated bubble trap (IBT) which have excellent properties, including simplicity in structure, ease in fabrication, no interference with the flow, and long-term stability. IBT-A provides the simplest solution to prevent bubbles from entering microfluidic channels. In situ time-lapse imaging experiments indicate that IBT-B is an excellent device both for bubble trapping and debubbling in cell-loaded microfluidics. MC 3T3 E1 cells, cultured in a long and curved microfluidic channel equipped with IBT-B, showed high viability and active proliferation after 10 days of continuous fluid flow. The comprehensive measures taken in our experiments have led to successful long-term, bubble-free, on-chip culture of cells. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010."
2010-11-01,Quaternized chitosan (QCS) nanoparticles as a novel delivery system for ammonium glycyrrhizinate,"The aim of this study was to generate a new type of nanoparticles made of quaternized chitosan (QCS) and poly(aspartic acid) via the ionotropic gelation technique and to evaluate their potential for the association and delivery of ammonium glycyrrhizinate (GLA). The effects of the pH value of nanoparticles, QCS molecular weight (Mw) and poly(aspartic acid) concentration on GLA encapsulation were studied. Suitably pH value of nanoparticles, moderate QCS MW, optimal concentration ratio of poly(aspartic acid) and QCS favored higher GLA encapsulation efficiency. The release of GLA from nanoparticles was pH-dependent. Fast release occurred in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH = 7.4), while the release was slow in 0.1 M HCI (pH = 1.2). The results showed that the new QCS/poly(aspartic acid) nanoparticles have a promising potential in GLA delivery system. Copyright © 2010 American Scientific Publishers."

In vivo, the probe significantly enhanced the MRI signal. The image contrast between the peripheral region of the tumor and the non-involved muscle was nearly 50% higher two hours after administration of the nanocomplex. The liposomal nanocomplex increased the amount of Gd accumulated in tumors by factor 2.8 compared to that accumulated by using Magnevist alone. Moreover, the heterogeneous MRI image features correlate well with the tumor pathology. The image enhancement patterns can be used for cancer prognosis and non-invasive monitoring of the response to therapy. Copyright © 2010 American Scientific Publishers."

A K-edge division method is proposed and applied to obtain the element mapping. Compared with the frequently used K-edge subtraction method, this ratio-contrast method is shown to be more accurate and sensitive in identifying the elements of interest, where the definition of the contrast threshold is simple and clear in physics. Several examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the method. © 2010 International Union of Crystallography."
2010-10-26,Control performance and biomembrane disturbance of carbon nanotube artificial water channels by nitrogen-doping,"To establish ways to control the performance of artificial water channels is a big challenge. With molecular dynamics studies, we found that water flow inside the water channels of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be controlled by reducing or intensifying interaction energy between water molecules and the wall of the CNTs channel. A way of example toward this significant goal was demonstrated by the doping of nitrogen into the wall of CNTs. Different ratios of nitrogen doping result in different controllable water performance which is dominated mainly through a gradient of van der Waals forces created by the heteroatom doping in the wall of CNTs. Further results revealed that the nitrogen-doped CNT channels show less influence on the integrality of biomembrane than the pristine one, while the nitrogen-doped double-walled carbon nanotube exhibits fewer disturbances to the cellular membrane integrality than the nitrogen-doped single-walled carbon nanotube when interacting with biomembranes. © 2010 American Chemical Society."

2010-10-01,Lysosomal proteolysis is the primary degradation pathway for cytosolic ferritin and cytosolic ferritin degradation is necessary for iron exit,"Cytosolic ferritins sequester and store iron, consequently protecting cells against iron-mediated free radical damage. However, the mechanisms of iron exit from the ferritin cage and reutilization are largely unknown. In a previous study, we found that mitochondrial ferritin (MtFt) expression led to a decrease in cytosolic ferritin. Here we showed that treatment with inhibitors of lysosomal proteases largely blocked cytosolic ferritin loss in both MtFt-expressing and wild-type cells. Moreover, cytosolic ferritin in cells treated with inhibitors of lysosomal proteases was found to store more iron than did cytosolic ferritins in untreated cells. The prevention of cytosolic ferritin degradation in MtFt-expressing cells significantly blocked iron mobilization from the protein cage induced by MtFt expression. These studies also showed that blockage of cytosolic ferritin loss by leupeptin resulted in decreased cytosolic ferritin synthesis and prolonged cytosolic ferritin stability, potentially resulting in diminished iron availability. Lastly, we found that proteasomes were responsible for cytosolic ferritin degradation in cells pretreated with ferric ammonium citrate. Thus, the current studies suggest that cytosolic ferritin degradation precedes the release of iron in MtFt-expressing cells; that MtFt-induced cytosolic ferritin decrease is partially preventable by lysosomal protease inhibitors; and that both lysosomal and proteasomal pathways may be involved in cytosolic ferritin degradation. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."
2010-10-01,Surface chemistry and aspect ratio mediated cellular uptake of Au nanorods,"Gold nanorods (Au NRs) have been recognized as promising materials for biomedical applications, like sensing, imaging, gene and drug delivery and therapy, but their toxicological issues are still controversial, especially for the Au NRs synthesized with seed-mediated method. In this study, we investigated the influence of aspect ratio and surface coating on their toxicity and cellular uptake. The cellular uptake is highly dependent on the aspect ratio and surface coating. However, the surface chemistry has the dominant roles since PDDAC-coated Au NRs exhibit a much greater ability to be internalized by the cells. The present data demonstrated shape-independent but coating-dependent cytotoxicity. Both the CTAB molecules left in the suspended solution and on the surface of Au NRs were identified as the actual cause of cytotoxicity. CTAB can enter cells with or without Au NRs, damage mitochondria, and then induce apoptosis. The effects of surface coating upon toxicity and cellular uptake were also examined using Au NRs with different coatings. When Au NRs were added into the medium, the proteins were quickly adsorbed onto the Au NRs that made the surface negatively charged. The surface charge may not directly affect the cellular uptake. We further demonstrated that the amount of serum proteins, especially for BSA, adsorbed on the Au NRs had a positive correlation with the capacity of Au NRs to enter cells. In addition, we have successfully revealed that the cationic PDDAC-coated Au NRs with an aspect ratio of 4 possess an ideal combination of both negligible toxicity and high cellular uptake efficiency, showing a great promise as photothermal therapeutic agents. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."
2010-10-01,Amphiphilic hyper-branched co-polymer nanoparticles for the controlled delivery of anti-tumor agents,"In this investigation, we have designed and synthesized an amphiphilic co-polymer with hyper-branched poly(amine-ester) and polylactide (HPAE-co-PLA) to generate nanoparticles (NPs). These have been used to encapsulate a highly active hydrophobic anti-tumor agent, 2-benzoylpyridine 4-ethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Bp4eT). Encapsulation in NPs was done in an effort to increase the anti-tumor activity of this agent by facilitating its delivery to tumor cells. We have also examined and optimized the formulation parameters of the NPs that alter their drug-loading capacity and their physical, chemical and biological properties. The resulting NPs exhibited high Bp4eT-loading capacity and substantial stability in aqueous solution. In vitro drug release studies demonstrated a controlled drug release profile with increased release at acidic pH. Anti-tumor proliferation assays showed that both free drug and drug-encapsulated NPs markedly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Direct microscopic observation revealed that the fluorescent NPs were taken up by cells and localized, in part, in organelles consistent with lysosomes. These results demonstrate a feasible application of the amphiphilic hyper-branched co-polymer, HPAE-co-PLA, as nanocarriers for intracellular delivery of potent anti-tumor agents. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."
2010-09-28,Enhanced gene delivery and siRNA silencing by gold nanoparticles coated with charge-reversal polyelectrolyte,"Charge-reversal functional gold nanoparticles first prepared by layer-by-layer technique were employed to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) and plasmid DNA into cancer cells. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis measurements of siRNA confirmed the occurrence of the charge-reversal property of functional gold nanoparticles. The expression efficiency of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was improved by adjuvant transfection with charge-reversal functional gold nanoparticles, which also had much lower toxicity to cell proliferation. Lamin A/C, an important nuclear envelope protein, was effectively silenced by lamin A/C-siRNA delivered by charge-reversal functional gold nanoparticles, whose knockdown efficiency was better than that of commercial Lipofectamine 2000. Confocal laser scanning microscopic images indicated that there was more cy5-siRNA distributed throughout the cytoplasm for cyanine 5-siRNA/polyethyleneimine/cis-aconitic anhydride-functionalized poly(allylamine)/ polyethyleneimine/11- mercaptoundecanoic acid-gold nanoparticle (cy5-siRNA/PEI/PAH-Cit/PEI/MUA-AuNP) complexes.

2010-09-15,Neuroprotective mechanism of mitochondrial ferritin on 6-hydroxydopamine- induced dopaminergic cell damage: Implication for neuroprotection in parkinson's disease,"Neuronal iron homeostasis disruption and oxidative stress are closely related to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Adult iron-regulatory protein 2 knockout (Ireb2-/-) mice develop iron accumulation in white matter tracts and nuclei in different brain area and display severe neurodegeneration in Purkinje cells of the cerebrum. Mitochondrial ferritin (MtFt), a newly discovered ferritin, specifically expresses in high energy-consuming cells, including neurons of brain and spinal cord. Interestingly, the decreased expression of MtFt in cerebrum, but not in striatum, matches the differential neurodegeneration pattern in these Ireb2 -/- mice. To explore its effect on neurodegeneration, the effects of MtFt expression on 6-hydrodopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neuronal damage was examined. The overexpression of MtFt led to a cytosolic iron deficiency in the neuronal cells and significantly prevented the alteration of iron redistribution induced by 6-OHDA. Importantly, MtFt strongly inhibited mitochondrial damage, decreased production of the reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation, and dramatically rescued apoptosis by regulating Bcl-2, Bax and caspase-3 pathways. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that MtFt plays an important role in preventing neuronal damage in an 6-OHDA-induced parkinsonian phenotype by maintaining iron homeostasis. Regulation of MtFt expression in neuronal cells may provide a new neuroprotective strategy for PD. Antioxid. © 2010 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

2010-09-08,Small molecule-capped gold nanoparticles as potent antibacterial agents that target gram-negative bacteria,"This report illustrates a new strategy in designing antibacterial agents-a series of commercially available compounds, amino-substituted pyrimidines (themselves completely inactive as antibiotics), when presented on gold nanoparticles (NPs), show antibacterial activities against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates, without external sources of energy such as IR. These pyrimidine-capped gold NPs exert their antibiotic actions via sequestration of magnesium or calcium ions to disrupt the bacterial cell membrane, resulting in leakage of cytoplasmic contents including nucleic acids from compromised cell membranes, and via interaction with DNA and inhibition of protein synthesis by internalized NPs. These amino-substituted pyrimidine-capped gold NPs induce bacterial resistance more slowly compared with conventional, small-molecule antibiotics and appear harmless to human cells; these NPs may hence be useful for clinical applications. © 2010 American Chemical Society."
2010-09-07,"Poly(ε-caprolactone)-graft-poly(2-(N, N-dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) nanoparticles: PH dependent thermo-sensitive multifunctional carriers for gene and drug delivery","pH-dependent temperature- sensitive poly(ε-caprolactone)-graft-poly(2- (dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) (PCL-g-PDMAEMA), a kind of degradable, amphiphilic, cationic copolymer, was synthesized. PCL-g-PDMAEMA was self-assembled into core-shell nanoparticles with an ultralow critical association concentration at about 8.1 × 10-4 g L-1. It was found that PCL-g-PDMAEMA nanoparticles were able to simultaneously entrap hydrophobic paclitaxel and load DNA. Hydrophobic drug paclitaxel, loaded by PCL-g-PDMAEMA NPs, could be released faster in an acidic environment than in a neutral environment, and PCL-g-PDMAEMA NPs showed a comparable in vitro gene transfection efficiency to Lipofectamine 2000. In addition, the gene transfection efficiency was enhanced by the addition of 5% serum. Besides, confocal microscopic measurements indicated that PCL-g-PDMAEMA nanoparticles/DNA polyplexes could escape from the endosome and release the payloads effectively in cytoplasm. These results suggest PCL-g-PDMAEMA has great potential for achieving the synergistic effect of drug and gene therapies in vivo. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry."
2010-09-01,State and local regulation of nanotechnology: Two opposing methodologies,"The nascent efforts of U.S. municipalities and states entering the nanotechnology regulation arena appear to be funneling them into one of two broad categories: Cities and states which are folding nanomaterials into their existing hazardous materials regulations, and cities and states which are forming task groups and committees to study the issues and provide feedback to the state. The first group is coalescing around the state's interest and responsibility in safeguarding the health of the public, its workers, and the environment. The second group generally has as one of its goals pursuing the potential economic and quality of life benefits that those states acknowledge may come from thoughtful application of nanotechnologies. This article offers a survey of the regulatory efforts pursued to date by cities-notably Berkeley, California and Cambridge, Massachusetts-and the several states which are venturing into the fray, and concludes that the second, more holistic approach to local and state-level regulation may yield the widest benefit to the citizen, the governing body, and the nanotechnology practitioner."

However, progress in this new discipline largely relies on developing methodology to characterize nanomaterials in biological samples, quantify nanoparticles in living systems, and study their uptake, translocation, biodistribution, location and chemical status in vitro and in vivo, etc. In this review article, we focus on the main features of synchrotron radiation-based methods and their application to the study of the toxicological activities of nanomaterials. Synchrotron radiation-based analytical techniques are shown to provide a potent means for characterizing the toxic or biological behaviors of nanoparticles in biological systems. © 2010 Springer-Verlag."
2010-09-01,Molecular interaction between europium decatungstate and histone H1 and its application as a novel biological labeling agent,"Polyoxometalates (POMs) show promising biological activities, but the mechanism of potential therapeutic effects remains to be elucidated at a molecular level. As a step toward the elucidation of the mechanistic pathways governing the bioactivity of POMs, the interaction between Eu-containing decatungstate [EuW10O36]9- (EuW10) and histone H1 has been studied. Fluorescence/luminescence analysis showed the existence of a strong interaction between EuW10 and histone H1. This interaction has key effects both on the luminescence of EuW10 and on the structure of histone H1. A gradual and intense enhancement of EuW10 luminescence was observed upon addition of increasing concentrations of histone H1. Circular dichroism investigations indicated that the binding of EuW10 significantly alters the secondary structure of histone H1. The present work is meaningful in finding novel labeling agents for fluorescence/luminescence or solid-state bioimaging. © 2010 SBIC."
2010-09-01,Development of neurons on micropatterns reveals that growth cone responds to a sharp change of concentration of laminin,"In this report we fabricated laminin (LN) stripes on a background of poly-L-lysine as substrates for the growth of rat hippocampal neurons, and found that a sharp change of the concentration of LN guides the growth of neurites by leading the growth cones in a time- and space-dependent manner. The percentage of neurites that grow along the edge of LN stripes (where there is a sharp change of concentration) decreases as a function of the concentration of LN under a threshold value. The actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in the process of growth cone's response to the sharp change of concentration of LN on micropatterns. We believe that the findings here are useful for not only fundamental studies in neuroscience, but also helpful for the design of devices or chips for nervous prosthesis. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2010-08-01,Both Nramp1 and DMT1 are necessary for efficient macrophage iron recycling,"Objective: Divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (Nramp1) are iron transporters that localize, respectively, to the early and late endosomal compartments. DMT1 is ubiquitously expressed, while Nramp1 is found only within macrophages and neutrophils. Our previous studies have identified a role for Nramp1 during macrophage erythrophagocytosis; however, little is known about the function of DMT1 during this process. Materials and Methods: Wild-type RAW264.7 macrophages (RAW), and those stably transfected with Nramp1 (RAW/Nramp1) were treated with either DMT1-small interfering RNA, or with ebselen, a selective inhibitor of DMT1. Results: Although macrophages lacking either functional DMT1 or Nramp1 experienced a moderate reduction in iron recycling efficiency, the ability of macrophages lacking both functional DMT1 and Nramp1 to recycle hemoglobin-derived iron was severely compromised. Compared to macrophages singly deficient in either DMT1 or Nramp1 transport ability, macrophages where DMT1 and Nramp1 were both compromised exhibited an abrogated increase in labile iron pool content, released less iron, and experienced diminished upregulation of ferroportin and heme-oxygenase 1 levels following erythrophagocytosis. Conclusions: These results suggest that although the loss of either Nramp1 or DMT1 transport ability results in minor impairment after erythrophagocytosis, the simultaneous loss of both Nramp1 and DMT1 iron transport activity is detrimental to the iron recycling capacity of the macrophage. © 2010 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells."
2010-07-06,Lung deposition and extrapulmonary translocation of nano-ceria after intratracheal instillation,"The broad potential applications of manufactured nanomaterials call for urgent assessment of their environmental and biological safety. However, most of the previous work focused on the cell level performance; little was known about the consequences of nanomaterial exposure at the whole-body and organ levels. In the present paper, the radiotracer technique was employed to study the pulmonary deposition and the translocation to secondary target organs after ceria nanoparticles (nano-ceria) were intratracheally instilled into Wistar rats. It was found that 63.9 8.2% of the instilled nano-ceria remained in the lung by 28d postexposure and the elimination half-life was 103d. At the end of the test period, only 1/8-1/3 of the daily elimination of nano-ceria from the lung was cleared via the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages(AMs) with subsequent removal towards the larynx was no longer the predominant route for the elimination of nano-ceria from the lung. The whole-body redistribution of nano-ceria demonstrated that the deposited nano-ceria could penetrate through the alveolar wall into the systemic circulation and accumulate in the extrapulmonary organs. In vitro study suggested that nano-ceria would agglomerate and form sediments in the bronchoalveolar aqueous surrounding while binding to protein would be conducive to the redispersion of nano-ceria. The decrease in the size of agglomerates might enhance the penetration of nano-ceria into the systemic circulation. Our findings suggested that the effect of nanomaterial exposure, even at low concentration, should be assessed because of the potential lung and systemic cumulative toxicity of the nanomaterials. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd."
2010-07-01,Specific hemosiderin deposition in spleen induced by a low dose of cisplatin: Altered iron metabolism and its implication as an acute hemosiderin formation model,"Cisplatin is one of the commonly-used chemotherapeutic drugs to efficiently treat malignant tumors in clinic, however, the adverse effects of cisplatin such as nephrotoxicity, neurotoxcity, and hemolytic uremic syndrome are often observed at its clinical doses (∼60 mg/m2), which limit its broader application. In earlier studies, little attention was paid to the subtle changes in the architecture of lymphatic organs after low doses of cisplatin treatment. This paper reviews current understanding of cisplatin-induced erythrocyte injury, and presents our latest finding that a low dose of cisplatin (3.6 mg/m2/day, 14 days) could induce specific hemosiderin deposition in spleen of both normal and hepatoma-22 (H22) inoculated Balb/C mice. This dose of cisplatin significantly inhibited H22-induced acute ascites development. No significant toxicity was induced by this dose of cisplatin to tissues except for hemosiderin accumulation in the spleen of both normal and H22 tumor-bearing mice. Increased splenic iron content and erythrocyte injury were observed after treatment with the low dose of cisplatin. The mRNA levels of ferroportin (FPN1) and ferritin were upregulated by 25 and 5-fold in spleen, respectively. Overexpression of FPN1 and ferritin protein were also been observed at protein levels by Western blotting analysis. In addition, the mRNA expression of hepcidin was also increased, suggesting blockage of iron recycling through FPN1 in spleen with cisplatin treatment. In conclusion, cisplatin treatment damages the erythrocytes which accumulate in the red pulp of spleen with defective recycling of FPN1 and ferritin protein. Hepcidin inhibits the function of FPN1 as iron-exporter leading to iron overloaded inside ferritins of splenic cells, which are stained with abnormal hemosiderin accumulation. These results demonstrate that cisplatin-caused hemosiderin deposition in spleen provides a valuable clue for understanding the molecular basis of toxicity of cisplatin and hemosiderin accumulation and iron metabolism in vivo. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd."
2010-07-01,Studies on anti-tumor and antimetastatic activities of fullerenol in a mouse breast cancer model,"The purpose was to examine the anti-tumor and antimetastatic activities of fullerenol and their related mechanisms. Thirty EMT-6 tumor-bearing mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.1 ml saline or 0.1 ml saline containing fullerenol C60(OH)20 (0.08 and 0.4 mg/ml) daily for 16 days. Using tumor tissues, we investigated imbalances in the oxidative defense system and the expression of several angiogenesis factors. C60(OH)20 exhibits anti-tumor and antimetastatic activities in EMT-6 breast cancer metastasis model. Treatment with C60(OH)20 was found to modulate oxidative stress significantly. The expression of several angiogenesis factors was reduced in tumor tissues after treatment with fullerenol. Importantly, CD31 (also known as PECAM-1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule) expression and vessel density were markedly reduced in tumors from fullerenol-treated mice compared with controls. Modulation of oxidative stress in tumor tissues, inhibition of the formation of angiogenesis factors, and subsequent reduction in tumor vessel density and the nutrient supply to tumor cells could be important mechanisms by which fullerenol aggregates inhibit tumor growth and suppress carcinoma metastasis in vivo. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

2010-06-18,Interchain coupling induced localization/delocalization in coupled one-dimensional ordered and disordered chains,"A different type of system with coupled ordered-disordered chains has given rise to considerable interest recently, as it has a variety of applications in nanostructures and biological systems such as DNA molecules. We investigate the localization/delocalization of coupled one-dimensional systems composed of one disordered chain (chain I) and another ordered chain (chain II), focusing on the interplay among the disorder, correlation, and interchain coupling. We find that for systems where chain I exhibits uncorrelated disorder, charge transport in chain I (II) is enhanced (suppressed), as the disorder in chain I leads to the localization of all states in both chains. However, for chain I with hopping amplitude t1 and long-range correlated disorder (with power-law spectral density and disorder strength W), we find there is a localization/delocalization transition for the case W≤4 t1, induced by interchain coupling. For W>4 t1, we find there is a quantum-phase transition at finite interchain coupling Vc: The interchain coupling induces appearance of two channels of extended states for V> Vc while there is only one channel of extended states for V< Vc. © 2010 The American Physical Society."
2010-06-16,A stretching device for imaging real-time molecular dynamics of live cells adhering to elastic membranes on inverted microscopes during the entire process of the stretch,"We present a device for stretching cells adhering to elastic membranes in equiaxial or uniaxial mode, meanwhile allowing real-time imaging of molecular dynamics of live cells at high resolution on an inverted microscope during the entire process of the stretch. We obtained high-resolution images of stress fibers at each stage of the stretch, and found that stress fibers were shortened after one stretching cycle. We, for the first time, captured real-time images of the process of stress fiber disassembly during stretching. Several adjacent stress fibers appeared to reassemble into a single one after stretching. All these indicated that mechanical stretching played important roles in the rearrangement of actin filaments. This device will be especially useful in studies of the molecular dynamics in the process of mechanotransduction. The device is fabricated on a glass slide through a simple procedure and is adaptable to most ordinary laboratories. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry."
2010-06-15,Using ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC ICP-MS to simultaneously determine Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in urine of chromate workers,"Urinary chromium speciation analysis can provide available information of the individual exposure levels of Cr(VI) compounds. An analytical method based on ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC combined with ICP-MS to simultaneously determine Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in human urine has been developed for assessing the occupational exposure to chromate. The separation conditions of the method, including the pH value, the concentrations of ion-pair reagent and methanol in the mobile phase were studied. Specially, a high-speed polyetheretherketone (PEEK) column and a typical sample introduction method were employed to avoid the exogenous chromium contamination during the analysis. The separation of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) could be finished within 4 min with the detection limits as low as 0.03 μg L-1 at 100 μL injections for both of them, providing a convenient method for routine analysis of chromium species. The chromium species in urine of chromate workers were monitored using the developed method. The statistical analysis showed a significant relationship (n = 32, p < 0.01) between the urinary Cr(VI) and the individual airborne exposure levels, indicating that the urinary Cr(VI) could be used as a convenient and suitable monitor for high level Cr(VI) occupational exposure. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

2010-06-01,Toxicity of zinc oxide nanoparticles to zebrafish embryo: A physicochemical study of toxicity mechanism,"The biological impact of engineered nanomaterials released into the aquatic environment is a major concern. In this work, the properties of ZnO nanoparticles (nano-ZnO, 30 nm) were characterized in a water suspension (E3 medium), and a zebrafish 96-h post fertilization (hpf) embryo-larval test was performed to assess the toxicity of nano-ZnO suspension. Nano-ZnO was found to readily form aggregates with different sizes; small aggregates (142.4-517.7 nm) were still suspended in E3 medium, but large aggregates (>1 μm) quickly deposited on the bottom of 24-well plates; nano-ZnO was partially dissolved to Zn species (Zn(dis)) in E3 medium. In the nano-ZnO suspension, small aggregates, Zn(dis), and large aggregates might jointly exert influence on the development of zebrafish embryos. The embryo toxicity test revealed that nano-ZnO killed zebrafish embryos (50 and 100 mg/L), retarded the embryo hatching (1-25 mg/L), reduced the bodylength of larvae, and caused tail malformation after the 96 hpf exposure. Zn(dis) only partially contributed to the toxicity of nano-ZnO. This research highlights the need to further investigate the ecotoxicity of nano-ZnO in the water environment."
2010-05-25,Potent angiogenesis inhibition by the particulate form of fullerene derivatives,"Antiangiogenesis is an effective strategy for cancer treatment because uncontrolled tumor growth depends on tumor angiogenesis and sufficient blood supply. Great progress has been made in developing a ""molecular"" form of angiogenesis inhibitors; however, the narrow inhibition spectrum limits anticancer efficacy as those inhibitors that usually target a few or even a single angiogenic factor among many angiogenic factors might initially be effective but ultimately lead to the failure of the treatment due to the induction of expression of other angiogenic factors. In this work, we report that with a multiple hydroxyl groups functionalized surface, the Gd@C 82(OH)22 fullerenic nanoparticles (f-NPs) are capable of simultaneously downregulating more than 10 angiogenic factors in the mRNA level that is further confirmed at the protein level. After studying this antiangiogenesis activity of the f-NPs by cellular experiment, we further investigated its anticancer efficacy in vivo. A two-week treatment with the f-NPs decreased >40% tumor microvessels density and efficiently lowered the speed of blood supply to tumor tissues by ∼ 40%. Efficacy of the treatment using f-NPs in nude mice was comparable to the clinic anticancer drug paclitaxel, while no pronounced side effects were found. These findings indicate that the f-NPs with multiple hydroxyl groups serve as a potent antiangiogenesis inhibitor that can simultaneously target multiple angiogenic factors. We propose that using nanoscale ""particulate"" itself as a new form of medicine (particulate medicine) may be superior to the traditional ""molecular"" form of medicine (molecular medicine) in cancer treatment. © 2010 American Chemical Society."
2010-05-19,The big red shift of photoluminescence of Mn dopants in strained CdS: A case study of Mn-doped MnS-CdS heteronanostructures,"The red photoluminescence of Mn dopants in MnS-CdS heteronanostructures has been observed for the first time. The red photoluminescence at 650 nm derives from emission due to the 4T→ 6Atransition of Mn 2+ dopants in a CdS matrix exposed to gigapascal-level lattice stress. HRTEM, FFT, XRD, and optical studies revealed that the lattice of Mn-doped CdS is compressed to match that of MnS when CdS crystallizes at the MnS surface to form MnS-CdS heteronanostructures. The photoluminescence decay times of such Mn dopants are on the order of nanoseconds because of the spin-flip interactions between Mn dopants and free carriers in the CdS matrix. © 2010 American Chemical Society."

The structures and the properties of the new polymers, Gd@C82-PS, were investigated by GPC, UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR, 13C NMR, CV/DPV, and XPS. The polymerization behavior of the metallofullerene and the properties of the Gd@C82-PS polymers were different from those of C60-PS and PS. Gd@C82 exhibited a stronger radical-scavenging ability than that of hollow fullerenes in the polymerization. Molecular weights and the electron-accepting ability of the polymers were discussed and possible mechanisms of the influences were proposed. © 2010 American Chemical Society."

Exposure to nano-ZnO suspension led to the decrease in glutathione (GSH) content, the inhibition in catalase (CAT) and superoxidase dismutase (SOD) activity, and the increase in MDA level of zebrafish embryo.The result demonstrates that oxidative stress was one of the mechanisms of nano-ZnO ecotoxicity."
2010-05-01,"Structures and electronic properties of M@Au<inf>6</inf> (M=Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ar) clusters: A density functional theory investigation","The geometries and electronic properties of the 3p electrons atoms doped gold cluster: M@Au6 clusters (M=Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ar) have been systematically investigated by using relativistic all-electron density functional theory (VPSR) and scalar relativistic effective core potential Stuttgart/Dresden (SDD) basis. Generalized gradient approximation in the Perdue-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional form is chosen for geometry optimization. A number of new isomers are obtained for neutral M@Au6 clusters. Both PBE/VPSR and PBE/SDD methods give similar lowest energy structure of each M@Au6cluster. With the exception of Ar@Au6, all doped clusters show larger relative binding energies compared with pure Au 7 cluster. It is found that all the ground-state structures of the M@Au6 clusters prefer the low symmetry structures, which is very different to the 3d transition-metal impurity doped Au6 clusters. Our results are in excellent agreement with available experiment data. © 2010 EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

However, acquired resistance confines its application in chemotherapeutics. To overcome the acquired resistance to cisplatin, it is reasoned, based on our previous findings of mediation of cellular responses by [Gd@C82(OH) 22]n nanoparticles, that [Gd@C82(OH)22]n may reverse tumor resistance to cisplatin by reactivating the impaired endocytosis of cisplatin-resistant human prostate cancer (CP-r) cells. Here we report that exposure of the CP-r PC-3-luc cells to cisplatin in the presence of nontoxic [Gd@C82(OH)22]n not only decreased the number of surviving CP-r cells but also inhibited growth of the CP-r tumors in athymic nude mice as measured by both optical and MRI. Labeling the CP-r PC-3 cells with transferrin, an endocytotic marker, demonstrated that pretreatment of the CP-r PC-3-luc cells with [Gd@C82(OH)22]n enhanced intracellular accumulation of cisplatin and formation of cisplatin-DNA adducts by restoring the defective endocytosis of the CP-r cancer cells. The results suggest that [Gd@C82(OH)22]n nanoparticles overcome tumor resistance to cisplatin by increasing its intracellular accumulation through the mechanism of restoring defective endocytosis. The technology can be extended to other challenges related to multidrug resistance often found in cancer treatments."
2010-04-12,"Enhanced exciton migration in electrospun poly[2-methoxy-5- (2′ -ethylhexyloxy)-1,4- phenylenevinylene]/poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) nanofibers","We present the studies on static and transient optical characteristics of electrospun poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′ -ethylhexyloxy)-1,4- phenylenevinylene]/ poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (MEH-PPV/PVP) nanofibers. [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester is mixed into the polymer matrix, working as quenchers to optical excitons. Comparing with the spin-coated films, the nanofibers exhibit enhanced exciton migration in speed and amplitude. The results are explained together with photoluminescent spectra blueshifting and longer exciton lifetime. Reduced aggregation and long-range order simultaneously induced by electric field are regarded as the mechanism for the phenomena. © 2010 American Institute of Physics."
2010-04-01,Loop-mediated isothermal amplification integrated on microfluidic chips for point-of-care quantitative detection of pathogens,"This work shows that loop-mediated isothermal amplifica-tion (LAMP) of nucleic acid can be integrated in an eight-channel microfluidic chip for readout either by the naked eye (as a result of the insoluble byproduct pyrophosphate generating during LAMP amplification) or via absorbance measured by an optic sensor; we call this system micro-LAMP (μLAMP). It is capable of analyzing target nucleic acids quantitatively with high sensitivity and specificity. The assay is straightforward in manipulation. It requires a sample volume of 0.4 μL and is complete within 1 h. The sensitivity of the assay is comparable to standard methods, where 10 fg of DNA sample could be detected under isothermal conditions (63 o°C). A real time quan-titative μLAMP assay using absorbance detection is pos-sible by integration of optical fibers within the chip. © 2010 American Chemical Society."
2010-03-24,Chemistry of carbon nanotubes in biomedical applications,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted great interdisciplinary interest due to their peculiar structural, mechanical and electronic properties. Applications of CNTs in biomedical research are being actively explored by many scientists worldwide. However, manipulation of CNTs is impeded by several problems, such as 1) formation of complex and entangled bundles; 2) very low solubility of CNTs in organic solvents and water; 3) inert properties of pristine CNTs under many chemical reaction conditions, etc. Chemical modification of CNTs has partly solved the above issues and is still one of the most effective means of manipulating and processing CNTs. Many bioapplications of CNTs rely on successful outer/inner surface functionalizations. This Feature Article is comprised of two main parts. In the first part, we briefly review the covalent surface chemistry for the CNT functionalization; in the second part, we focus on the biomedical applications of surface chemistry for CNTs, in particular, the chemistry for controlling biomedical functions and meanwhile lowering nanotoxicity of CNTs. We also analyze the underlying factors that led to the controversy in the previous experimental data of safety studies of CNTs. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry."
2010-03-12,Applications and toxicological issues surrounding nanotechnology in the food industry,"With the rapid development of nanotechnology, the presence of nanoparticles (NPs) in commercially available products is becoming more and more common. The field of food nanotechnology has experienced significant growth over the last five years. Agricultural cultivation, food processing, food packaging, food security, and water purification are examples of the important sectors linked with nanotechnology in the food production chain. However, safety concerns about such nanotechnology and the use of nanomaterials are increasing. Many determinants for the unusual activities and toxicities of the nanomaterials involving particle size, chemical composition, surface structure, and dosage are considered as well as three main exposure routes, including inhalation, ingestion, and dermal exposure. In addition, the trends and progress for toxicity and risk evaluation of the nanomaterials used in the food industry are also reviewed, which are helpful to understand and establish a regulatory system for the further development and use of NPs in the food industry. © 2010 IUPAC."
2010-03-08,Physico-chemical behaviour and algal toxicity of nanoparticulate CeO <inf>2</inf> in freshwater,"In assessing the risks posed by nanomaterials in the environment, the overriding research challenges are to determine if nanomaterials are more toxic than the bulk forms of the same material, and the extent to which toxicity is governed by particle size and reactivity. In this study, the toxicity of nanoparticulate CeO2 (nominally 1020 nm) to the freshwater alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata was compared to the same material at the micron size (nominally ≤ 5 μ m). Growth inhibition experiments revealed inhibitory concentration values, giving 50% reduction in algal growth rate after 72 h (IC50), of 10.3 ± 1.7 and 66 ± 22 mg L -1 for the nanoparticles and bulk materials respectively. Cells exposed to CeO2 particles were permeable to the DNA-binding dye SYTOX® Green in a concentration-dependent manner indicating damage to the cell membrane. Screening assays to assess the oxidative activity of the particles showed that the light illumination conditions used during standard algal bioassays are sufficient to stimulate photocatalytic activity of CeO2 particles, causing the generation of hydroxyl radicals and peroxidation of a model plant fatty acid. No oxidative activity or lipid peroxidation was observed in the dark. These findings indicate that inhibitory mode of action of CeO2 to P. subcapitata is mediated by a cell-particle interaction causing membrane damage. The effect is most likely photochemically induced and is enhanced for the nanoparticulate form of the CeO2.© CSIRO 2010."
2010-03-05,Size-dependent mechanical properties of PVA nanofibers reduced via air plasma treatment,Organic nanowires/fibers have great potential in applications such as organic electronics and soft electronic techniques. Therefore investigation of their mechanical performance is of importance. The Young's modulus of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanofibers was analyzed by scanning probe microscopy (SPM) methods. Air plasma treatment was used to reduce the nanofibers to different sizes. Size-dependent mechanical properties of PVA nanofibers were studied and revealed that the Young's modulus increased dramatically when the scales became very small (<80 nm).

The precursor was obtained via precipitation route using Ti(SO4)2. The characterization of the as-prepared sample was confirmed by TEM, XRD, UV-Vis and low temperature N2 adsorption measurements(BET). The photocatalytic activity was also investigated by the degradation of methyl orange solutions. The particles of the as-synthesized sample with narrow size distribution had an average diameter of about 24 nm. The specific BET surface area of the as-synthesized sample was about 56 m 2·g-1, which is similar to the commercial TiO2(P25). The prepared materials showed the similar photocatalytic activity when compared with the performance of commercial TiO2(P25)."

Most currently used anti-HIV drugs are reverse transcriptase inhibitors or protease inhibitors. The expanding application of simulation to drug design combined with experimental techniques have developed a large amount of novel inhibitors that interact specifically with targets besides transcriptase and protease.

In this paper, we report that [Gd@C82(OH)22]n could induce phenotypic maturation of dendritic cells by stimulating DC production of cytokines including IL-12p70, upregulating DC co-stimulatory (CD80, CD83, and CD86) and MHC (HLA-A,B,C and HLA-DR) molecules, and switching DCs from a CCL5-responsive to a CCL19-responsive phenotype. We found that [Gd@C 82(OH)22]n can induce dendritic cells to become functionally mature as illustrated by their capacity to activate allogeneic T cells. Mice immunized with ovalbumin in the presence of [Gd@C 82(OH)22]n exhibit enhanced ovalbumin-specific Th1-polarized immune response as evidenced by the predominantly increased production of IFN-, IL-1-, and IL-2. The [Gd@C82(OH) 22]n nanoparticle is a potent activator of dendritic cells and Th1 immune responses. These new findings also provide a rational understanding of the potent anticancer activities of [Gd@C82(OH) 22]n nanoparticles reported previously. © 2010 American Chemical Society."

2010-01-26,Use of a rapid cytotoxicity screening approach to engineer a safer zinc oxide nanoparticle through iron doping,"The establishment of verifiably safe nanotechnology requires the development of assessment tools to identify hazardous nanomaterial properties that could be modified to improve nanomaterial safety. While there is a lot of debate of what constitutes appropriate safety screening methods, one approach is to use the assessment of cellular injury pathways to collect knowledge about hazardous material properties that could lead to harm to humans and the environment. We demonstrate the use of a multiparameter cytotoxicity assay that evaluates toxic oxidative stress to compare the effects of titanium dioxide (TiO 2), cerium oxide (CeO 2), and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles in bronchial epithelial and macrophage cell lines. The nanoparticles were chosen on the basis of their volume of production and likelihood of spread to the environment. Among the materials, dissolution of ZnO nanoparticles and Zn 2+ release were capable of ROS generation and activation of an integrated cytotoxic pathway that includes intracellular calcium flux, mitochondrial depolarization, and plasma membrane leakage. These responses were chosen on the basis of the compatibility of the fluorescent dyes that contemporaneously assess their response characteristics by a semiautomated epifluorescence procedure. Purposeful reduction of ZnO cytotoxicity was achieved by iron doping, which changed the material matrix to slow Zn 2+ release. In summary, we demonstrate the utility of a rapid throughput, integrated biological oxidative stress response pathway to perform hazard ranking of a small batch of metal oxide nanoparticles, in addition to showing how this assay can be used to improve nanosafety by decreasing ZnO dissolution through Fe doping. © 2010 American Chemical Society."
2010-01-19,Fabrication of necklace-like structures via electrospinning,"We report a one-step method to fabricate necklace-like structures from zero-dimensional materials via electrospinning. PVA was used as polymer matrix for accomplishing necklace-like arrays of silica particles. We systemically investigated how the diameter of SiO2 particles, the weight ratio of PVA to SiO2, the voltage, and the relative content of PVA/SiO 2/H2O influenced the morphology of electrospun fibers. SiO2 particles with diameter of 143 nm tended to aggregate into bunches in the fibers, while 265 and 910 nm SiO2 particles tended to align along the fibers one by one, resembling necklaces. The content of water in the PVA/SiO2/H2O solution showed critical influence on the diameter of fibers and consequently determined the morphology. Too thin solutions gave birth to blackberry-like structure; too condensed solution was too hard to eject from the orifice of the needle; when the ingredient was elaborately tailored, we obtained necklace-like structures. We believe that these results can serve as references to generating other complex structures involving polymers and particles via electrospinning and that these structures will be potentially useful in photoelectric devices, drug release, and optical components. © 2009 American Chemical Society."
2010-01-15,"Probing the magnetic and structural properties of the 3d, 4d, 5d impurities encapsulated in an icosahedral Ag<inf>12</inf> cage","The geometries, electronic, and magnetic properties of the 3d, 4d, 5d impurities encapsulated in an icosahedral Ag12 cage have been systematically investigated by using relativistic all-electron density functional theory with generalized gradient approximation. The general features of the properties of 3d, 4d, 5d transition-metal atoms doped Ag12 clusters are probed and compared. It is found that the most stable structure for all M@Ag12 clusters (M=3d, 4d and 5d transition-metal atoms) is the icosahedral structure with Ih symmetries, in which the transition-metal atom is located in the center of the Ag12 cage. All doped clusters show larger relative binding energies compared with pure icosahedral Ag13 cluster, indicating that doping by 3d, 4d, 5d transition-metal atoms could stabilize the Ag12 icosahedron and form a new binary alloy cluster. The calculation of the magnetic properties demonstrates that the magnetic moments of M@Ag12 clusters vary from 0 to 4μB by doping different transition-metal atom into Ag12 icosahedron, suggesting that the transition-metal-doped Ag12 clusters could have potential utility in new nanomaterials as building blocks with tunable magnetic properties. © 2009 Elsevier B.V."
2010-01-01,Functionalization of Cloisite 30B with fluorescent dyes,"An organo-montmorillonite (Cloisite® 30B) was modified with fluorescent dyes to obtain photo-functional inorganic-organic complexes for real-time monitoring of polymer-clay nanocomposite processing. The photo-functionalization with 9-anthracenemethanol (anth) was tested using adsorption from solution, as well as dry and melt compounding. Rhodamine 6G Perchlorate (RhP) and Nile Blue A Perchlorate (NBAP) were adsorbed by cation exchange. XRD, TGA and spectrofluorimetry showed that cation exchange in water/ethanol at 80 °C, with an added amount of RhP corresponding to 25% of the initial surfactant content, followed by washing, recovering and drying, yielded the best results. The intercalation of the fluorescent dyes rearranged the paraffinic structure of the surfactant molecules by increasing the tilting angle from 37° to 49°. © 2010 Elsevier B.V."

Bright red, green, and blue luminescence was achieved, respectively, from ZnGa2O4:Cr3+, ZnGa2O4:Mn2+, and ZnGa2O4 nanowire arrays under ultra-violet light irradiation.

2010-01-01,"Characterization of gold nanorods in vivo by integrated analytical techniques: Their uptake, retention, and chemical forms","Integrated analytical techniques were used to study the tissue distribution and structural information of gold nanorods (Au NRs) in Sprague-Dawley rats through tail intravenous injection. Before in vivo experiments were conducted, careful characterization of Au NRs was performed. The zeta potential proved that adsorption of bovine serum albumin on Au NRs turned the surface charges from positive to negative as in an in vitro simulation. The biodistribution of Au NRs was investigated quantitatively by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry at different time points after injection. As target tissues, both liver and spleen were chosen to further demonstrate the intracellular localization of Au NRs by the combination of transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Moreover, synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy was employed and it was observed that long-term retention of Au NRs in liver and spleen did not induce obvious changes in the oxidation states of gold. Therefore, the present systematic method can provide important information about the fates of Au NRs in vivo and can also be extended to study the biological effects of other metallic nanomaterials in the future. © 2009 Springer-Verlag."

The electrical mobility diameters of the generated particles are ranging from 9 to 19 nm for Pt, 9 to 90 nm for TiO2, and 15 to 90 nm for graphite. Toward this purpose, two specific test benches were used: one for the filter-based devices which are tested under a controlled air flow, and the other one for protective clothing and gloves under diffusion and without air flow. Different types of nanoaerosols, such as TiO2, Pt, and graphite, were generated. Electrostatic and HEPA (High Efficiency Particle Air) filters have shown the highest efficiency for graphite nanoparticles. The main hypothesis for explaining this effect is that electrostatic forces could enhance the graphite nanoparticles capture. Air-tight fabrics made of non-woven textile seem much more efficient in protecting workers against Pt, and TiO2 nanoparticles than cotton and polypropylene. With regard to protective clothing, no obvious effect linked to the aerosol type was observed. Gloves are found very efficient for TiO2 and Pt nanoaerosols. Therefore, no effect of aerosol on the protection efficiency of gloves was evidenced. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."
2010-01-01,Circumventing tumor resistance to chemotherapy by nanotechnology.,"Patient relapse and metastasis of malignant cells is very common after standard cancer treatment with surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Chemotherapy, a cornerstone in the development of present day cancer therapy, is one of the most effective and potent strategies to treat malignant tumors. However, the resistance of cancer cells to the drugs remains a significant impediment to successful chemotherapy. An additional obstacle is the inability of chemotherapeutic drugs to selectively target tumor cells. Almost all the anticancer agents have severe side effects on normal tissues and organs. The toxicity of currently available anticancer drugs and the inefficiency of chemotherapeutic treatments, especially for advanced stages of the disease, have limited the optimization of clinical drug combinations and effective chemotherapeutic protocols. Nanomedicine allows the release of drugs by biodegradation and self-regulation of nanomaterials in vitro and in vivo. Nanotechnologies are characterized by effective drug encapsulation, controllable self-assembly, specificity and biocompatibility as a result of their own material properties. Nanotechnology has the potential to overcome current chemotherapeutic barriers in cancer treatment, because of the unique nanoscale size and distinctive bioeffects of nanomaterials. Nanotechnology may help to solve the problems associated with traditional chemotherapy and multidrug resistance."
2010-01-01,Personal protective equipment against nanoparticles,"Nanomaterials manufacture and use are in full expansion. With them comes an increasing risk for human health, especially at the workplace. Indeed, the early signs of potential toxicity associated with nanotechnologies are piling up. Even if they must be considered as a last resource in a traditional occupational Health & Safety approach, personal protective equipment (PPE) against nanoparticles need to be available right away, while the other more upstream risk management strategies are developed, assessed and put into action. However, the current picture of the situation relative to PPE against nanoparticles is rather worrying. For one part, there is an almost complete void worldwide in terms of regulations, standard testing methods and selection guides relative to PPE against nanoparticles. In addition, even if most claim that certified respirators should offer the needed level of protection against nanoparticles, large uncertainties remain, in particular in relation with the thermal rebound effect reported by some researchers for particles as large as 20 nm, as well as the high potential of inward leaks at interfaces. In terms of protective clothing and gloves, the subject is largely unexplored, maybe because of the common belief that skin is an impervious membrane and that protective clothing against chemical risks is efficient in case of exposure to nanoparticles. Yet, both assertions are questioned by recent findings, demonstrating the urgent need for more research in this area. Copyright © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."
2010-01-01,Effects of rare earth oxide nanoparticles on root elongation of plants,"The phytotoxicity of four rare earth oxide nanoparticles, nano-CeO2, nano-La2O3, nano-Gd2O3 and nano-Yb2O3 on seven higher plant species (radish, rape, tomato, lettuce, wheat, cabbage, and cucumber) were investigated in the present study by means of root elongation experiments. Their effects on root growth varied greatly between different nanoparticles and plant species. A suspension of 2000 mg L-1 nano-CeO2 had no effect on the root elongation of six plants, except lettuce. On the contrary, 2000 mg L-1 suspensions of nano-La2O3, nano-Gd2O3 and nano-Yb2O3 severely inhibited the root elongation of all the seven species. Inhibitory effects of nano-La2O3, nano-Gd2O3, and nano-Yb2O3 also differed in the different growth process of plants. For wheat, the inhibition mainly took place during the seed incubation process, while lettuce and rape were inhibited on both seed soaking and incubation process. The fifty percent inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for rape were about 40 mg L-1 of nano-La2O3, 20 mg L-1 of nano-Gd2O3, and 70 mg L-1 of nano-Yb2O3, respectively. In the concentration ranges used in this study, the RE3+ ion released from the nanoparticles had negligible effects on the root elongation. These results are helpful in understanding phytotoxicity of rare earth oxide nanoparticles. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

2009-12-14,Electrospinning of poly(dimethylsiloxane)/poly(methyl methacrylate) nanofibrous membrane: Fabrication and application in protein microarrays,"Fabrication of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) nanofibers is critical to harness the advantage of nanostructured membrane applied in protein microarrays. Electrospinning (ES) of PDMS nanofibers is challenging because of the relatively low molecular weight of PDMS prepolymer. We report a strategy to fabricate PDMS/PMMA nanofibers via ES by introducing carrier polymer PMMA into PDMS solutions to supplement the deficiency of chain entanglements in the PDMS prepolymer. The prepared PDMS/PMMA nanofibrous membrane (PDMS/PMMA NFM) was successfully used as substrates for protein microarrays. The results of immunoassays showed the superior performance of PDMS/PMMA NFM as 3D substrate for protein microarrays; the limit-of-detection (LOD) on PDMS/PMMA NFM was 32 times lower than that on nitrocellulose membrane. The realization of ES PDMS extends the scope of ES materials from thermoplastic polymers to thermosetting materials. Given the simplicity, low cost, and high efficiency of ES technology, we believe that PDMS/PMMA NFM is a promising 3D substrate for protein microarrays. © 2009 American Chemical Society."

However, while the prefix nano has leaked into popular language, its very concept is still unclear to most people. Nanotechnology is innovative in character; it is currently moving from the laboratory to industrial manufacturing and marketing; significant public and private investments are going into development and promotion; and the anticipated benefits are considerable. For all of these reasons, the Québec Commission de l'éthique de la science et de la technologie (CEST) has decided to explore nanotechnology from an ethical perspective and to publish a position statement on the subject. For the purpose of a global reflection on nanotechnology, the Commission has deemed important to consider such aspects as the size of nanometric particles, the means of manipulating materials (top-down and bottom-up), multidisciplinary approaches and the convergence of disciplines with respect to nanotechnology as well as a general fascination with nanotechnology.

The new field of nanosafety has emerged and need to be explored now rather than after problems become so ubiquitous and difficult to treat that their trend become irreversible. Such endeavour necessitates a transdisciplinary approach. A commonly forgotten and/or misunderstood risk is that of explosion/detonation of nanopowders, due to their high specific active surface areas. Such risk is emphasized and illustrated with the present development of an appropriate risk analysis. For this particular risk, a review of characterization methods and their limitations with regard to nanopowders is presented and illustrated for a few organic and metallic nanopowders."

2009-11-26,Measurement of nanofiller removal by abrasion,"In the frame of the European NanoSafe2 project, CEA designed and qualified a specific bench test to measure the release of nanofillers from nanomaterials. In the proposed set up the material to be tested is mechanically solicited by abrasion using a normalized Taber equipment. The sensitivity of the method has been drastically optimized by reducing the background noise counts and the streaming air flow. The results show that even materials without any nanofiller can generate nanoparticles when submitted to abrasion. Furthermore, tests show that nanofillers can be released in usage by abrasion for non optimised nanoproducts. This confirms the interest to develop such a method. The normalized abrasion process itself is critical for the removal and the aérosolisation of the nanoparticles which both drive the sensitivity of the method. The abrasion process has to be optimized in a realistic and consensual way for standardization."

The apoptosis of cerebral microvessel endothelial cells (CMECs) induced by oxidative stress injury plays a key role in the dysfunction of BBB. By use of CMECs as an in vitro BBB model, we show for the first time that C60(C(COOH)2)2 nanoparticles can selectively enter oxidized CMECs rather than normal cells, and maintain CMECs integrity by attenuating H2O2-induced F-actin depolymerization via the observation of several state-of-the art microscopic techniques. Additionally, we have found that C60(C(COOH) 2)2 nanoparticles greatly inhibit the apoptosis of CMECs induced by H2O2, which is related to their modulation of the JNK pathway. C60(C(COOH)2)2 nanoparticles can regulate several downstream signaling events related to the JNK pathway, including reduction of JNK phosphorylation, activation of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and caspase-3, and inhibition of polyADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Our results indicate that C60(C(COOH)2)2 nanoparticles possess a novel ability of selectively entering oxidation-damaged cerebral endothelial cells rather than normal endothelial cells and then protecting them from apoptosis. © 2009 American Chemical Society."

Zhang et al.,The purpose of the present study is to develop a new method to prepare magnetite chitosan microspheres conjugated with methotrexate (MTX) for the controlled release of MTX as a magnetic targeting drug delivery system. MTX was first conjugated to the chitosan chain via a peptide bond and then a suspension cross-linking technique was used for the production of magnetic chitosan microspheres with glutaraldehyde as the cross-linker. The MTX-loading capacity of the magnetic chitosan microspheres was determined and drug release experiments were also carried out to discuss the MTX release behavior. All the data support that the magnetic chitosan-MTX microspheres prepared in this method would have great potential application in magnetic targeting drug delivery technology. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd.
2009-11-04,Charge transport in DNA molecules: Cooperative interplay between the disordered base-pair channel and the ordered backbone,"Charge transport in DNA molecules has raised considerable interest because of its importance in biological processes and potential applications in nanoscale devices. A DNA molecule can be viewed as a quasi-one-dimensional system composed of stacked base pairs (AT, CG) together with backbones of sugar phosphates. Motivated by recent experimental observations on the importance of the backbone integrity, we investigate the interplay between charge transport through the ordered backbone and disordered base stacks with random sequences. By analytical and numerical calculations, we find that the coupling between the backbone and base-pair channels plays an important role in charge transport. The backbone can generate effective hopping constants well beyond the adjacent base pairs, enhancing charge transport through the base-pair channel. The corresponding enhancement of the localization length is nearly independent of the length of the DNA and increases with increasing coupling between backbone and base pair.

2009-10-01,Respiratory protection against airborne nanoparticles: A review,"As a precautionary measure, it is often recommended that workers take steps to reduce their exposure to airborne nanoparticles through the use of respiratory protective devices. The purpose of this study was to provide a review and analysis of the research literature and current recommendations on respirators used for protection against nanoparticles. Key research findings were that studies with particles as small as 4 nm have shown that conventional single-fiber filtration theory can be used to describe the filtration performance of respirators and that the most penetrating particle size for respirators equipped with commonly used electrostatic filter media is in the range of 30-100 nm. Future research needs include human laboratory and workplace protection factor studies to measure the respirator total inward leakage of nanoparticles. Industrial hygienists and safety professionals should continue to use traditional respirator selection guidance for workers exposed to nanoparticles. © 2009 US Government."
2009-09-29,"Current evaluation of the millennium phytomedicine - Ginseng (II): Collected chemical entities, modern pharmacology, and clinical applications emanated from traditional chinese medicine","This review, a sequel to part 1 in the series, collects about 107 chemical entities separated from the roots, leaves and flower buds of Panax ginseng, quinquefolius and notoginseng, and categorizes these entities into about 18 groups based on their structural similarity. The bioactivities of these chemical entities are described. The 'Yin and Yang' theory and the fundamentals of the 'five elements' applied to the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are concisely introduced to help readers understand how ginseng balances the dynamic equilibrium of human physiological processes from the TCM perspectives. This paper concerns the observation and experimental investigation of biological activities of ginseng used in the TCM of past and present cultures. The current biological findings of ginseng and its medical applications are narrated and critically discussed, including 1) its antihyperglycemic effect that may benefit type II diabetics; in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated protection of ginseng on beta-cells and obese diabetic mouse models. The related clinical trial results are stated. 2) its aphrodisiac effect and cardiovascular effect that partially attribute to ginseng's bioactivity on nitric oxide (NO); 3) its cognitive effect and neuropharmacological effect that are intensively tested in various rat models using purified ginsenosides and show a hope to treat Parkinson's disease (PD); 4) its uses as an adjuvant or immunotherapeutic agent to enhance immune activity, appetite and life quality of cancer patients during their chemotherapy and radiation. Although the apoptotic effect of ginsenosides, especially Rh2, Rg3 and Compound K, on various tumor cells has been shown via different pathways, their clinical effectiveness remains to be tested. This paper also updates the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and immune-stimulatory activities of ginseng, its ingredients and commercial products, as well as common side effects of ginseng mainly due to its overdose, and its pharmacokinetics. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd."

Ostuni, S. Takayama, X.Y. Jiang, D.E. Ingber, Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering 3 (2001) 335]. Recent advances in micro-/nano-technology have resulted in an explosion of the number of new tools available for biochemical sciences. We have used surface chemistry, nano-structures and microfluidics to create a set of tools applicable for problems ranging from molecular to cellular analysis. These tools will promote the understanding of fundamental problems in cell biology, development and neurobiology, and become useful for real-world applications such as molecular diagnostics, food analysis and environmental monitoring. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

2009-09-01,Incorporation of electrospun nanofibrous PVDF membranes into a microfluidic chip assembled by PDMS and scotch tape for immunoassays,"This paper demonstrates a microfluidic chip for multiple immunoassays on electrospun (ES) nanofibrous membranes made of PVDF. This microchip enables the detection of multiple pairs of protein-protein interactions in one experiment by crossing parallel arrays of microchannels. This chip uses ESPVDF membrane with high specific surface area as the substrate to adsorb protein for immobilized immunoassays so that increased levels of protein adsorption may lower the LOD in immunoassays. We employ a simple and effective method for chip assembly by scotch tape to incorporate the ESPVDF membrane into the microchip. We believe that the present work will facilitate the development of methods for the on-site diagnosis of diseases whose detection is based on antigen-antibody recognition, and improve the efficiencies of certain experiments that need to identify tens to hundreds of protein-protein interactions with relatively low cost in the future. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2009-09-01,"Nanoparticles: Their potential toxicity, waste and environmental management","This literature review discusses specific issues related to handling of waste containing nanomaterials. The aims are (1) to highlight problems related to uncontrolled release of nanoparticles to the environment through waste disposal, and (2) to introduce the topics of nanowaste and nanotoxicology to the waste management community. Many nanoparticles used by industry contain heavy metals, thus toxicity and bioaccumulation of heavy metals contained in nanoparticles may become important environmental issues. Although bioavailability of heavy metals contained in nanoparticles can be lower than those present in soluble form, the toxicity resulting from their intrinsic nature (e.g. their size, shape or density) may be significant. An approach to the treatment of nanowaste requires understanding of all its properties - not only chemical, but also physical and biological. Progress in nanowaste management also requires studies of the environmental impact of the new materials. The authors believe Amara's law is applicable to the impact of nanotechnologies, and society might overestimate the short-term effects of these technologies, while underestimating the long-term effects. It is necessary to have basic information from companies about the level and nature of nanomaterials produced or emitted and about the expectation of the life cycle time of nanoproducts as a basis to estimate the level of nanowaste in the future. Without knowing how companies plan to use and store recycled and nonrecycled nanomaterials, development of regulations is difficult. Tagging of nanoproducts is proposed as a means to facilitate separation and recovery of nanomaterials. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

In this study, the impact of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nano-TiO2) on the phyllosphere bacterial community were analysed by both a culturable-dependent method and a polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) method. The quantity of culturable phyllosphere bacteria was significantly reduced with an increased concentration of nano-TiO2. With increasing concentrations from 0.002 to 20 mg/ml of nano-TiO2, the quantity of culturable phyllosphere bacteria decreased from 1.8×106 to 3.1×105 cfu/g. The phyllosphere bacteria community was analysed by PCR-DGGE, and when the concentrations of nano-TiO2 were higher than 0.02 mg/ml, the DGGE bands were significantly lower than in the control. Sequencing results of the bands from the DGGE gel showed that there were at least seven genera in the phyllosphere bacteria. Only one uncultured bacterium was unaffected by the concentration of nano-TiO2. © China Agricultural University 2009."
2009-08-01,Overexpression of mitochondrial ferritin sensitizes cells to oxidative stress via an iron-mediated mechanism,"Mitochondrial ferritin (MtFt) is a newly identified H-ferritin-like protein expressed only in mitochondria. Previous studies have shown that its overexpression markedly affects intracellular iron homeostasis and rescues defects caused by frataxin deficiency. To assess how MtFt exerts its function under oxidative stress conditions, MtFt overexpressing cells were treated with tert-butyl-hydroperoxide (tBHP), and the effects of MtFt expression on cell survival and iron homeostasis were examined. We found that MtFt expression was associated with decreased mitochondrial metabolic activity and reduced glutathione levels as well as a concomitant increase in reactive oxygen species levels and apoptosis. Moreover, mechanistic studies demonstrated that tBHP treatment led to a prolonged decrease in cytosolic ferritins levels in MtFt-expressing cells, while ferritin levels recovered to basal levels in control counterparts. tBHP treatment also resulted in elevated transferrin receptors, followed by more iron acquisition in MtFt expressing cells. The high molecular weight desferrioxamine, targeting to lysosomes, as well as the hydrophobic iron chelator salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone significantly attenuated tBHP-induced cell damage. In conclusion, the current study indicates that both the newly acquired iron from the extracellular environment and internal iron redistribution from ferritin degradation may be responsible for the increased sensitivity to oxidative stress in MtFt-expressing cells. © Copyright 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2009."
2009-08-01,The effect of Gd@C<inf>82</inf>(OH)<inf>22</inf> nanoparticles on the release of Th1/Th2 cytokines and induction of TNF-α mediated cellular immunity,"It is known that down-regulation of the immune response may be associated with the progenesis, development and prognosis of cancer or infectious diseases. Up-regulating the immune response in vivo is therefore a desirable strategy for clinical treatment. Here we report that poly-hydroxylated metallofullerenol (Gd@C82(OH)22) has biomedical functions useful in anticancer therapy arising from immunomodulatory effects observed both in vivo and in vitro. We found that metallofullerenol can inhibit the growth of tumors, and shows specific immunomodulatory effects on T cells and macrophages. These effects include polarizing the cytokine balance towards Th1 (T-helper cell type 1) cytokines, decreasing the production of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6), and increasing the production of Th1 cytokines (IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF-α) in the serum samples. Immune-system regulation by this nanomaterial showed dose-dependent behavior: at a low concentration, Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles slightly affected the activity of immune cells in vitro, while at a high concentration, they markedly enhanced immune responses and stimulated immune cells to release more cytokines, helping eliminate abnormal cells. Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles stimulated T cells and macrophages to release significantly greater quantities of TNF-α, which plays a key role in cellular immune processes. Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles are more effective in inhibiting tumor growth in mice than some clinical anticancer drugs but have negligible side effects. The underlying mechanism for high anticancer activity may be attributed to the fact that this water-soluble nanomaterial effectively triggers the host immune system to scavenge tumor cells. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

2009-07-22,Oxidation unzipping of stable nanographenes into joint spin-rich fragments,"When an all-benzenoid nanographene is linearly unzipped into oxygen-joined fragments, the oxidized benzenoid rings (aromatic sextets) selectively adopt the low-spin (ΔS = 0) or high-spin conformation (ΔS = 1) to yield the thermally most stable isomer. The selection of the conformation depends simply on the position of the aromatic sextets: the inner ones prefer the high-spin conformation, whereas the peripheral ones prefer the low-spin conformation. Therefore, the resulting most stable isomer has a total spin whose value equals the number of inner aromatic sextets (ni) along the oxidizing line. The nanographene fragments contained in this isomer have a ferromagnetic spin coupling. Due to the tautomerization between the high-spin and low-spin conformations, there also exist other possible isomers with higher energies and with spins at ground state ranging from 0 to (ni - 1). The rich geometrically correlated spins and the adjustable energy gaps indicate great potential of the graphene oxides in spintronic devices. © 2009 American Chemical Society."

Animals homozygous for hypomorphic mutations in either mre11 or nbs develop normally with minimal telomere dysfunction. However, they produce inviable embryos that succumb to failure of mitosis caused by covalent fusion of telomeric DNA. Interestingly, the molecular defect is not the absence of MRN interaction or of Mre11 nuclease activities, but the depletion of the maternal pool of Nbs protein in these embryos. Because of Nbs depletion, Mre11 and Rad50 (MR) are excluded from chromatin. This maternal effect lethality in Drosophila is similar to that seen in mice carrying hypomorphic mrn mutations found in human patients, suggesting a common defect in telomere maintenance because of the loss of MRN integrity."
2009-06-29,Fullerene derivatives protect endothelial cells against NO-induced damage,"Functional fullerene derivatives have been demonstrated with potent antioxidation properties. Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical that plays a part in leading to brain damage when it is accumulated to a high concentration. The possible scavenging activity of NO by the hydroxylated fullerene derivative C60(OH)22 and malonic acid derivative C 60(C(COOH)2)2 was investigated using primary rat brain cerebral microvessel endothelial cells (CMECs). Results demonstrate that sodium nitroprusside (SNP), used as an NO donor, caused a marked decrease in cell viability and an increase in apoptosis. However, fullerene derivatives can remarkably protect against the apoptosis induced by NO assault. In addition, fullerene derivatives can also prevent NO-induced depolymerization of cytoskeleton and damage of the nucleus and accelerate endothelial cell repair. Further investigation shows that the sudden increase of the intercellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by NO was significantly attenuated by post-treatment with fullerene derivatives. Our results suggest that functional fullerene derivatives are potential applications for NO-related disorders. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd."
2009-06-01,Fabrication and photocatalytic activity of Pt-inserted titania nanotubes,"Titania nanotubes (TNTs) were synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of rutile-phase TiO2 nanoparticals in NaOH solution at 110°C for 24 hours. After drying in aceton for 36 h, the TNTs were under vacuum drying for 24 h at room temperature. The Pt-inserted titania nanotubes (Pt/TNTs) were obtained by filling H2PtCl6 ethanol solution into the TNTs after vacuum drying. The characterizations of the as-synthesized samples were confirmed by TEM, XRD, and UV-Vis. The photocatalytic activity of the Pt/TNTs was investigated by photo-induced decomposition of methyl orange (MO) under the main 365 nm UV-light. In order to comparison, the photocatalytic activity of both the rutile-phase TiO2 nanoparticles and pure TNTs were also investigated at the same time under the same experimental conditions. The TEM images show that the TNTs are hollow, a few hundred nanometers long, and the inner/outer diameter is about 6/10 nm. The crystal structure of TNTs is H2Ti2O5·H2O with a little Na. Both the shape and the crystalline of the TNTs are not changed after the modification. The oval or round Pt0 nanoparticals, about 3 nm in diameter, are found only in the nanotubes. Pt/TNTs exhibit enhanced absorption at the visible range in the UV-Vis spectra and its start absorption band edge (λ0≈457 nm) is obviously redshifted compared to the rutile-phase TiO2 nanoparticals and pure TNTs. The Pt nanoparticles are found to significantly enhance the photocatalytic activity of TNTs. Pt/TNTs are demonstrated to be highly efficient for the UV-light induced photocatalytic decomposition of MO compared to both the rutile-phase TiO2 nanoparticals and pure TNTs. After irradiation for 60 min, the photocatalysis decomposition rate of MO in rutile-phase TiO2 nanoparticals, TNTs and Pt/TNTs are 46.8%, 57.2% and 84.6% respectively."
2009-05-15,Characterization of the ATPase activity of a novel chimeric fusion protein consisting of the two nucleotide binding domains of MRP1,"Nucleotide Binding Domains (NBDs) are responsible for the ATPase activity of the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1). A series of NBD1-linker-NBD2 chimeric fusion proteins were constructed, expressed and purified, and their ATPase activities were analyzed. We report here that a GST linked NBD1642-890-GST-NBD21286-1531 was able to hydrolyze ATP at a rate of about 4.6 nmol/mg/min (Km = 2.17 mM, Vmax = 12.36 nmol/mg/min), which was comparable to the purified and reconstituted MRP1. In contrast, neither a mixture of NBD1 and GST-NBD2 nor the NBD1-GST-NBD1 fusion protein showed detectable ATPase activity. Additionally, the E1455Q mutant was found to be nonfunctional. Measurements by both MIANS labeling and circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed significant conformational differences in the NBD1-GST-NBD2 chimeric fusion protein compared to the mixture of NBD1 and GST-NBD2. The results suggest a direct interaction mediated by GST between the two NBDs of MRP1 leading to conformational changes which would enhance its ATPase activity. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Will corporations blindside investors with “the next asbestos?” Existing disclosures are found lacking in the specificity needed to forewarn of liabilities and reputational damage from the use of potentially harmful materials— from nanotechnologies, to asthmagens, to perfluorinated compounds. Improved standards could protect investors while also enhancing corporate incentives to use safer materials.

2009-04-15,Electrochemistry of symmetrical fullerene dimer C<inf>121</inf> film modified electrodes,"C121 and C121/didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) film modified electrodes have been constructed and their electrochemistry has been studied. In the acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate, the C121 films show three couples of relatively stable redox peaks corresponding to three two-electron transfer processes involving reduction of two fullerene units in the dimers. In an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium bromide, the C121 films display an irreversible reduction peak, whereas the C121/DDAB films display two couples of quasi-reversible redox peaks with the splitting first peak, and the C121/DDAB films have good reversibility and stability in the aqueous solution due to existence of DDAB. All of these experimental results indicate that voltammetric behaviors of the C121 films are different from those of C60 films due to different structures though C121 is carbon-bridged C60 dimer, and the common characteristics are that their electrochemical behaviors are dependent on the nature of solvent and cation of supporting electrolyte. Furthermore, electrocatalysis of H2O2 at the C121/DDAB films was explored in the aqueous solution, which indicates that C121 is a good electron-transfer mediator. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Three bands are resolved in the valence band region. The first band for n-type BGG is sensitive to temperature, while the second band is sensitive for p-type BGG. The change in the ratio of Ba to Ga, from which the carrier type is controlled in this system, modifies the positions of Ga residing at the larger (Ga-CGe)24 cage.

The surface chemical component, structure and bond of uncoated and dextran-coated nanoparticles were measured by synchrotraon radiation XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). Qualitative and quantitative analysis of Cls and Ols of Fe3O4 and dextran-Fe3O4 showed that the Fe3O4 nanoparticles were successively coated by sodium citrate via Fe-O-C bond, and dextrans, which can be linked with their carboxylate moiety via hydrogen bond. Sodium citrate could enhance the disperse stability of reaction system and hydrophilicity of dextran-Fe3O4."
2009-04-01,Influence of titanium dioxide nanoparticles on speciation and bioavailability of arsenite,"In this study, the influence of the co-existence of TiO2 nanoparticles on the speciation of arsenite [As(III)] was studied by observing its adsorption and valence changing. Moreover, the influence of TiO2 nanoparticles on the bioavailability of As(III) was examined by bioaccumulation test using carp (Cyprinus carpio). The results showed that TiO2 nanoparticles have a significant adsorption capacity for As (III). Equilibrium was established within 30 min, with about 30% of the initial As (III) being adsorbed onto TiO2 nanoparticles. Most of aqueous As (III) was oxidized to As(V) in the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles under sunlight. The carp accumulated considerably more As in the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles than in the absence of TiO2 nanoparticles, and after 25-day exposure, As concentration in carp increased by 44%. Accumulation of As in viscera, gills and muscle of the carp was significantly enhanced by the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Pulmonary retention and extrapulmonary redistribution of inhaled nanoparticles have been considered to be important contributing factors of cardiorespiratory diseases. In the present work, 22-nm 59Fe2O3 nanoparticles (radioactive isotope 59 <Fe-labeled ferric oxide nanoparticles) were intratracheally instilled into the male Sprague-Dawley rats at a dose of 4 mg/rat. Extrapulmonary distribution of 59Fe2O3 in organs and its metabolism in lung, blood, urine, and feces were measured for 50 days of exposure. Phagocytosis and clearance of agglomerated nano-Fe2 O3 by monocytes/macrophages were observed by histopathology and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry examination. Our results showed intratracheal-instilled nano-59Fe2 O3 could pass through the alveolar-capillary barrier into systemic circulation within 10 min that consisted with one-compartment kinetic model. The nano-59Fe2O3 in the lung was distributed to organs rich in mononuclear phagocytes, including liver, spleen, kidney and testicle. The plasma elimination half-life of nano-59Fe2O3 was 22.8 days and the lung clearance rate was 3.06 μg/day, indicating the systemic accumulation and lung retention had occurred. The deposited nano-Fe2 O3 in interstitial lung was probably contributed by the particles escaping from alveolar macrophages phagocytosis and macrophages clearance function overloading. Our results suggest that the effect of Fe2O3 nanoparticles exposure, even at low concentration, should be assessed because of the potential lung and systemic cumulative toxicity of the nanoparticles. © The Author 2008.

Chemotaxis plays a vital role in cancer cell metastasis. In the current study, we reported that epidermal growth factor (EGF) induced a robust chemotaxis of A549 and H1299 cells, two representative human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Chelerythrine chloride, an inhibitor of all protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes, significantly reduced the chemotactic capacity of NSCLC cells while inhibitors of classical or novel PKC isozymes, such as Gö6976, calphostin C, or Gö6850, showed no effect, which suggested that atypical PKC might be involved in the chemotactic process of NSCLC cells. EGF-elicited translocation and phosphorylation of atypical PKCζ, indicating that EGF could activate PKCζ. Treatment with a PKCζ specific inhibitor, a myristoylated pseudosubstrate, blocked the chemotaxis in a dose-dependent manner, further confirming that atypical PKCζ was required for NSCLC chemotaxis. Mechanistic studies suggested that PKCζ was regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt. Furthermore, PKCζ-mediated chemotaxis by regulating actin polymerization and cell adhesion. Taken together, our study suggested that PKCζ was required in NSCLC cell chemotaxis, thus could be used as a target to develop anti-lung cancer metastasis therapies. © 2008."
2009-02-01,The scavenging of reactive oxygen species and the potential for cell protection by functionalized fullerene materials,"We demonstrated that three different types of water-soluble fullerenes materials can intercept all of the major physiologically relevant ROS. C60(C(COOH)2)2, C60(OH)22, and Gd@C82(OH)22 can protect cells against H2O2-induced oxidative damage, stabilize the mitochondrial membrane potential and reduce intracellular ROS production with the following relative potencies: Gd@C82(OH)22 ≥ C60(OH)22 > C60(C(COOH)2)2. Consistent with their cytoprotective abilities, these derivatives can scavenge the stable 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl radical (DPPH), and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) superoxide radical anion (O2{radical dot}-), singlet oxygen, and hydroxyl radical (HO{radical dot}), and can also efficiently inhibit lipid peroxidation in vitro. The observed differences in free radical-scavenging capabilities support the hypothesis that both chemical properties, such as surface chemistry induced differences in electron affinity, and physical properties, such as degree of aggregation, influence the biological and biomedical activities of functionalized fullerenes. This represents the first report that different types of fullerene derivatives can scavenge all physiologically relevant ROS. The role of oxidative stress and damage in the etiology and progression of many diseases suggests that these fullerene derivatives may be valuable in vivo cytoprotective and therapeutic agents. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd."

2009-01-01,"Guidelines for safe handling, use and disposal of nanoparticles","Health, safety and environmental (HSE) risks of a technology is an inseparable part of it which threatens all exposed employees. It has been proved for many years that exposure to particles, in an occupational setting, could be linked with the onset of lung diseases, such as pneumoconiosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and mesotelioma and lung cancer. Nanoparticles, due to their unique characteristics including; small size, shape, high surface area, charge, chemical properties, solubility, and degree of agglomeration can cross cell boundaries or pass directly from the lungs into the blood stream and ultimately reach to all of the organs in the body. This is the reason why they may pose higher risk than the same mass and material of larger particles. Moreover, biodegradation of nanoparticles by some kinds of fungi (like wood decay fungi) may result in metabolites which may be toxic to microorganisms under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Bacteria and living cells can take up nanoparticles, providing the basis for potential bioaccumulation in the food chain. Considering Iran's prominent position in nanotechnologies and fast-growing in research and industrial activities, controlling nanoparticles related HSE risks should be highly considered. In general, there are three main approaches to risk and exposure control: engineering techniques, administrative means and personal protective equipments. These complementary approaches especially engineering techniques should be considered starting with the design stage of an industrial process. Administrative means of control constitute an additional approach when the other methods have not achieved the expected control levels. Administrative means of control must never substitute for engineering techniques, which always be performed according to standard practices. In some situations, due to insufficiently advanced technology and prohibitive costs, engineering measerus can not be implemended.

2009-01-01,Explosion risks from nanomaterials,"Emerging nanomanufactured products are being incorporated in a variety of consumer products ranging from closer body contact products (i.e. cosmetics, sunscreens, toothpastes, pharmaceuticals, clothing) to more remote body-contact products (electronics, plastics, tires, automotive and aeronautical), hence posing potential health and environmental risks. The new field of nanosafety has emerged and needs to be explored now rather than after problems becomes so ubiquitous and difficult to treat that their trend become irreversible. Such endeavour necessitates a transdisciplinary approach. A commonly forgotten and/or misunderstood risk is that of explosion/detonation of nanopowders, due to their high specific active surface areas. Such risk is emphasized and illustrated with the present development of an appropriate risk analysis. For this particular risk, a review of characterization methods and their limitations with regard to nanopowders is presented and illustrated for a few organic and metallic nanopowders. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd."
2009-01-01,Simultaneous determination of trace Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in water using ion-pairing reversed phase chromatography - Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry,"A method was developed to simultaneously determine trace chromium species in water using ion-pairing reversed phase chromatography (RPIPC)-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). The chromatographic parameters were optimized to get the best separation, including the pH value of mobile phase, the concentrations of ion-pair reagent and methanol and the addition of EDTA in the mobile phase. The optimium mobile phase was 2.0 mmol/L tetrabutylammonium(TBA), 5% methanol(v/v), pH=5.5. Using collision cell technology to eliminate the mass interferences of 40Ar 12C+ and 35Cl16OH+ in the analysis of 52Cr+, and the detection limits of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) were 0.15 μg/L and 0.16 μg/L for 100 μL injections. The recovery range of spiked Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in water samples was 93.6%-106.2% and the RSDs were less than 4% (n =3). The results were satisfying when analyzing the chromium speciation in drinking water and rain water using this method."
2009-01-01,Effects of several nanooxides on the hatching rate of zebrafish embryos,"The ecotoxicological impacts of nanooxides (nano-ZnO, nano-TiO2, nano-Fe2O3, nano-Fe3O4 and nano-SiO2) were studied by observing the hatching rate of zebrafish embryos at 96h. Different nanooxides had different effects on hatching rate of zebrafish embryos, suggesting that the toxicity was much related to their own components. Nano-ZnO decreased the hatching rate of embryos in a concentration-dependent way and had a higher toxicity. At low concentration, the inhibition of nano-ZnO on embryo hatching was more severe than Zn2+ of the same concentration, probably due to its own special properties. The hatching rate of zebrafish embryos did not affected by nano-FeO at low conenttation, but was inhibited at high concentration. Other nanooxides, including nano-TiO2, nano-Fe3O4 and nano-SiO2, had little effect on embryo hatching."
2009-01-01,Particle size distribution of iron nanomaterials in biological medium by SR-SAXS method,"A better understanding of biological effects of nanomaterials in organisms requests knowledge of the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials in biological systems. Affected by high concentration salts and proteins in biological medium, nanoparticles are much easy to agglomerate, hence the difficulties in characterizing size distribution of the nanomaterials in biological medium. In this work, synchrotron radiation small angle X-ray scattering (SR-SAXS) was used to determine size distributions of Fe, Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 nanoparticles of various concentrations in PBS and DMEM culture medium. The results show that size distributions of the nanomaterials could perfectly analyzed by SR-SAXS. The SR-SAXS data were not affected by the particle content and types of the dispersion medium. It is concluded that SR-SAXS can be used for size measurement of nanomaterials in unstable dispersion systems."
2009-01-01,Neurotoxicity of low-dose repeatedly intranasal instillation of nano- and submicron-sized ferric oxide particles in mice,"Olfactory tract has been demonstrated to be an important portal for inhaled solid nanoparticle transportation into the central nervous system (CNS). We have previously demonstrated that intranasally instilled Fe2O 3 nanoparticles could transport into the CNS via olfactory pathway. In this study, we investigated the neurotoxicity and size effect of repeatedly low-dose (130 μg) intranasal exposure of nano- and submicron-sized Fe 2O3 particles (21 nm and 280 nm) to mice. The biomarkers of oxidative stress, activity of nitric oxide synthases and release of monoamine neurotransmitter in the brain were studied. Our results showed that significant oxidative stress was induced by the two sizes of Fe2O3 particles. The activities of GSH-Px, Cu,Zn-SOD, and cNOS significantly elevated and the total GSH and GSH/GSSG ratio significantly decreased in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus after the nano- and submicron-sized Fe2O 3 particle treatment (p < 0.05). The nano-sized Fe 2O3 generally induced greater alteration and more significant dose-effect response than the submicron-sized particle did. Some slight perturbation of monoamine neurotransmitters were found in the hippocampus after exposure to the two sizes of Fe2O3 particle. The TEM image showed that some ultrastructural alterations in nerve cells, including neurodendron degeneration, membranous structure disruption and lysosome increase in the olfactory bulb, slight dilation in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and lysosome increase in the hippocampus were induced by the nano-sized Fe2O3 treatment. In contrast, in the submicron-sized Fe2O3 treated mice, slightly swollen mitochondria and some vacuoles were observed in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus, respectively. These results indicate that intranasal exposure of Fe2O3 nanoparticles could induce more severe oxidative stress and nerve cell damage in the brain than the larger particle did. This is the first study to compare the neurotoxicity of nano- and submicron-sized Fe2O3 particles in the central nervous system after long-term and low-dose intranasal exposure. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."
2008-12-15,Potential neurological lesion after nasal instillation of TiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles in the anatase and rutile crystal phases,"Nanoscale titanium dioxide (TiO2) is massively produced and widely used in living environment, which hence make the potential risk to human health. Central nervous system (CNS) is the potential susceptible target of inhaled nanoparticles, but the studies on this aspect are limited so far. We report the accumulation and toxicity results in vivo of two crystalline phases of TiO2 nanoparticles (80 nm, rutile and 155 nm, anatase; purity >99%). The female mice were intranasally instilled with 500 μg of TiO2 nanoparticles suspension every other day for 30 days. Synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence analysis (SRXRF) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were used to determine the contents of titanium in murine brain. Then, the pathological examination of brain tissue, oxidative stress-mediated responses, and levels of neurochemicals in the brain of exposed mice were also analyzed. The obvious morphological changes of hippocampal neurons and increased GFAP-positive astrocytes in the CA4 region were observed, which were in good agreements with higher Ti contents in the hippocampus region. Oxidative stress occurred obviously in whole brain of exposed mice such as lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and increased activities of catalase, as well as the excessive release of glutamic acid and nitric oxide. These findings indicate anatase TiO2 nanoparticles exhibited higher concern on some tested biological effects. To summarize, results provided the preliminary evidence that nasal instilled TiO2 nanoparticles could be translocated into the central nervous system and cause potential lesion of brain, and the hippocampus would be the main target within brain. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2008-12-05,Time-dependent translocation and potential impairment on central nervous system by intranasally instilled TiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles,"Nanoparticles can be administered via nasal, oral, intraocular, intratracheal (pulmonary toxicity), tail vein and other routes. Here, we focus on the time-dependent translocation and potential damage of TiO2 nanoparticles on central nervous system (CNS) through intranasal instillation. Size and structural properties are important to assess biological effects of TiO2 nanoparticles. In present study, female mice were intranasally instilled with two types of well-characterized TiO2 nanoparticles (i.e. 80 nm, rutile and 155 nm, anatase; purity > 99%) every other day. Pure water instilled mice were served as controls. The brain tissues were collected and evaluated for accumulation and distribution of TiO2, histopathology, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers at post-instillation time points of 2, 10, 20 and 30 days. The titanium contents in the sub-brain regions including olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results indicated that the instilled TiO2 directly entered the brain through olfactory bulb in the whole exposure period, especially deposited in the hippocampus region. After exposure for 30 days, the pathological changes were observed in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb using Nissl staining and transmission electron microscope. The oxidative damage expressed as lipid peroxidation increased significantly, in particular in the exposed group of anatase TiO2 particles at 30 days postexposure. Exposure to anatase TiO2 particles also produced higher inflammation responses, in association with the significantly increased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL-1β) levels. We conclude that subtle differences in responses to anatase TiO2 particles versus the rutile ones could be related to crystal structure. Thus, based on these results, rutile ultrafine-TiO2 particles are expected to have a little lower risk potential for producing adverse effects on central nervous system. Although understanding the mechanisms requires further investigation, the present results suggest that we should pay attention to potential risk of occupational exposure for large-scaled production of TiO2 nanoparticles. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2008-12-01,Preparation and photocatalytic performance of titania nanotubes loaded with Ag nanoparticles,"Titania nanotubes (TNTs) were synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of rutile-phase TiO2 nanoparticles in 10 mol· L-1 NaOH solution at 110 °C for 24 h. The Ag loaded titania nanotubes (Ag/TNTs) were obtained by chemical deposition method with the TNTs suspending in the AgNO3 solution (pH=8) at 50 °C. The characterizations of the as-synthesized samples were performed by TEM, EDS, XRD, XPS, and UV-Vis spectra. The photocatalytic performance of the Ag/TNTs was investigated by UV-light induced photocatalytic decomposition of methyl orange(MO). The results showed that the inner/outer diameters of TNTs were about 6/10 nm and the length was several hundred nanometers. Both the shape and the crystalline of the nanotubes were not changed after the modification. The zero oxidation state Ag quantum dots, about 4 nm in diameter, were well dispersed on the external surface of the nanotubes. Ag/TNTs exhibited enhanced absorption at the visible range in the UV-Vis spectra. The Ag nanoparticles were found to significantly enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanotubes, and the catalyst system was demonstrated to be highly efficient for the UV-light induced photocatalytic decomposition of MO compared to both rutile-phase TiO2 nanoparticles and pure TNTs. After irradiation for 60 min, the decomposition rates of MO solution in rutile-phase TiO2 nanoparticles, TNTs, and Ag/TNTs system were 46.8%, 57.2%, and 92.2%, respectively. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica."
2008-12-01,Biological effect of intranasally instilled titanium dioxide nanoparticles on female mice,"The toxicological effect of TiO2 nanoparticles with different crystal structure (80 nm for rutile and 155 nm for anatase) on female mice was investigated through intranasal instillation. After exposure for 30 days at the dose of 50 mg/kg body weight, no abnormal activity and mortality were observed with the normally increasing body weight of mice. The coefficients of tissues to body weight also show no obvious difference from the control except the increased coefficient of kidneys in mice exposed to 80 nm TiO2 nanoparticles. Titanium contents and histopathology examination indicate the no pathological response in the lung was induced by the increased TiO2 deposition, and the liver, heart, and spleen were not influenced. The severe pathology changes in kidneys suggest that TiO2 nanoparticles may be excreted out by kidneys via system circulation. However, the serum biochemical parameters were not changed compared with the control, which means no obvious functional impairment induced by the nasal exposure for 30 days. In addition, the higher titanium contents in the brain tissues imply that the translocation and deposition of nanoparticles through intranasal instilling pathway is different from the other routes such as intratracheal inhalation or intratracheal instillation. The influence of deposited nanoparticles on central nervous system needs further investigation and is underway. © World Scientific Publishing Company."
2008-12-01,Trace metal disturbance in mice brain after intranasal exposure of nano- and submicron-sized Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> particles,"Trace metals in the brain play an important role in the function of central nervous system (CNS). The objective of this work is to investigate the effects of intranasal exposure of nano- and submicron-sized Fe2O3 particles on the homeostasis of trace metals in the brain. After a single intranasal instillation of nano- and submicron-sized Fe2O3 particles, the con-tents of Fe, Cu and Zn in the sub-brain regions were determined in the time course from 4 h till to the 30 day post-exposure. Our results indicated that the imbalance of trace metals in the sub-brain regions of mice was induced by the two sizes of Fe2O3 particles. The more significant accumulation of Fe in the brain was found in the nano-Fe 2O3 treated mice than in the submicron-Fe 2O3 treated ones: meanwhile, similar alterations of Zn contents in the brain were observed as well. A strong positive correlation between Fe and Zn levels in the olfactory bulb of nano-Fe2O 3 instilled mice and in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of submicron-Fe2O3 instilled mice were found. This is the first trial to investigate the disturbance of trace metals in the brain after exposure to Fe2O3 nanoparticles. These results state that much attention should be paid to the potential impact of inhaled Fe 2O3 nanoparticles on the CNS."
2008-12-01,Biopharmaceutics and therapeutic potential of engineered nanomaterials,"Engineered nanomaterials are at the leading edge of the rapidly developing nanosciences and are founding an important class of new materials with specific physicochemical properties different from bulk materials with the same compositions. The potential for nanomaterials is rapidly expanding with novel applications constantly being explored in different areas. The unique size-dependent properties of nanomaterials make them very attractive for pharmaceutical applications. Investigations of physical, chemical and biological properties of engineered nanomaterials have yielded valuable information. Cytotoxic effects of certain engineered nanomaterials towards malignant cells form the basis for one aspect of nanomedicine. It is inferred that size, three dimensional shape, hydrophobicity and electronic configurations make them an appealing subject in medicinal chemistry. Their unique structure coupled with immense scope for derivatization forms a base for exciting developments in therapeutics. This review article addresses the fate of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of engineered nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo. It updates the distinctive methodology used for studying the biopharmaceutics of nanoparticles. This review addresses the future potential and safety concerns and genotoxicity of nanoparticle formulations in general. It particularly emphasizes the effects of nanoparticles on metabolic enzymes as well as the parenteral or inhalation administration routes of nanoparticle formulations. This paper illustrates the potential of nanomedicine by discussing biopharmaceutics of fullerene derivatives and their suitability for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

Toxicologic sensitivity of nanoparticles in different ages was investigated for the first time to demonstrate and explain an age-related difference in response to manufactured nanoparticles. Young, adult, and old rats physiologically inhaled air containing aerosol of manufactured SiO2 nanoparticles (24.1 mg/m3; 40 min/day) for four weeks. Changes in serum biomarkers, hemorheologic, pulmonary inflammation, heart injury, and pathology in rats of different ages and their corresponding controls were compared. Inhalation of SiO2 nanoparticles under identical conditions caused pulmonary and cardiovascular alterations in old rats, yet less change in young and adult rats, including pulmonary inflammation, myocardial ischemic damage, atrio-ventricular blockage, and increase in fibrinogen concentration and blood viscosity. Old individuals were more sensitive to nanoparticle exposure than the young and adult rats. The risk of causing pulmonary damages was: old > young > adult The risk of cardiovascular disorder was observed only in old age. Our results suggest that different ages may require different biomarkers for identifying pulmonary toxicity during inhalation of nanoparticles. © 2008 American Chemical Society."

2008-10-01,Inhibition of tumor growth by endohedral metallofullerenol nanoparticles optimized as reactive oxygen species scavenger,"Intraperitoneal injection of [Gd@C82(OH)22] n nanoparticles decreased activities of enzymes associated with the metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tumor-bearing mice. Several physiologically relevant ROS were directly scavenged by nanoparticles, and lipid peroxidation was inhibited in this study. [Gd@C82(OH) 22]n nanoparticles significantly reduced the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal of the stable 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl radical measured by ESR spectroscopy. Likewise, studies using ESR with spin-trapping demonstrated efficient scavenging of superoxide radical anion, hydroxyl radical, and singlet oxygen (1O2) by [Gd@C82(OH) 22]n nanoparticles. In vitro studies using liposomes prepared from bovine liver phosphatidylcholine revealed that nanoparticles also had a strong inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation. Consistent with their ability to scavenge ROS and inhibit lipid peroxidation, we determined that [Gd@C82(OH)22]n nanoparticles also protected cells subjected in vitro to oxidative stress. Studies using human lung adenocarcinoma cells or rat brain capillary endothelial cells demonstrated that [Gd@C82(OH)22]n nanoparticles reduced H 2O2-induced ROS formation and mitochondrial damage. [Gd@C82(OH)22]n nanoparticles efficiently inhibited the growth of malignant tumors in vivo. In summary, the results obtained in this study reveal antitumor activities of [Gd@C82(OH) 22]n nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo. Because ROS are known to be implicated in the etiology of a wide range of human diseases, including cancer, the present findings demonstrate that the potent inhibition of [Gd@C82(OH)22]n nanoparticles on tumor growth likely relates with typical capacity of scavenging reactive oxygen species.

2008-10-01,Eliminating active species by endohedral metallofullerenol in vitro and in vivo,"We previously demonstrated that gadolinium endohedral metallofullerenol Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles had high inhibitory activity on growth of malignant tumor in vivo by uncertain mechanism(s). The activities of enzymes associated with the metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were decreased in the tumor-bearing mice by intraperitoneally injection of Gd@C 82(OH)22 nanoparticles. In current study, systemic investigation of the potential function of Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles found that it expressed direct scavenging activity toward active species. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, the state-of-art technique to measure chemical active species that have one or more unpaired electrons in parallel, was employed to measure free radicals scavenging activities of Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles in vitro. Pre-treatment with Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles significantly reduced ESR signal of various of reactive oxygen species. In addition, Gd@C 82(OH)22 nanoparticles demonstrated extensively scavenging activities of active species measured in vivo, which was consistent with reduced progression of cancer cells treated with Gd@C82(OH) 22 nanoparticles. In summary, results obtained in this study revealed strong active species-scavenging activities of Gd@C82(OH) 22 nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo. Scavenging activities of hydroxylated Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles was systemically measured in different milieu, and demonstrated the inhibition of tumor progression by treatment with Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles likely due to eliminating active species."
2008-10-01,Long-term accumulation and low toxicity of single-walled carbon nanotubes in intravenously exposed mice,"The biomedical application of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), such as drug delivery and cancer treatment, requires a clear understanding of their fate and toxicological profile after intravenous administration. In this study, the long-term accumulation and toxicity of intravenously injected SWCNTs in the main organs (such as liver, lung and spleen) in mice were carefully studied. Although SWCNTs stayed in mice over 3 months, they showed low toxicity to mice. The long-term accumulation of SWCNTs in the main organs was evidenced by using Raman spectroscopy and TEM technique. Statistically significant changes in organ indices and serum biochemical parameters (LDH, ALT and AST) were observed. The histological observations demonstrate that slight inflammation and inflammatory cell infiltration occurred in lung, but the serum immunological indicators (CH 50 level and TNF-α level) remained unchanged. No apoptosis was induced in the main organs. The decreasing glutathione (GSH) level and increasing malondialdehyde (MDA) level suggest that the toxicity of SWCNTs might be due to the oxidative stress. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The beneficial uses of nanomaterials may cause human exposure through inhalation, ingestion, skin uptake, and intravenous injection. When nanomaterials interact with biological systems, they may generate adverse biological effects. The possible toxic effects of these nanomaterials are unknown until now. The positive applications in biomedicine as well as the negative biological effects of nanomaterials on cardiovascular, respiratory and other systems are highlighted, the possible mechanisms by which nanoparticles result in cardiovascular and pulmonary morbidity are also discussed, and the possible interaction routes and sequences is farther reviewed. Finally, the perspective of risk assessment of nanomaterials in the nature is summarized."
2008-09-01,SIRT1 contributes in part to cisplatin resistance in cancer cells by altering mitochondrial metabolism,"Tumors frequently develop resistance to cisplatin, a platinum drug used as a cornerstone of present-day chemotherapy regimens, significantly decreasing its usefulness in the clinic. Although it is known that cisplatin-resistant (CP-r) cancer cells commonly grow more slowly and exhibit reduced uptake of various compounds, including nutrients,the effect of tumor metabolism on cisplatin resistance is unclear. It was found that in CP-r cells, uptake of 2-deoxyglucose was reduced due to dysfunction and altered morphology of mitochondria compared with cisplatin-sensitive parental cancer cells. The CP-r cells overexpressed SIRT1, a histone deacetylase that plays a central role in DNA damage response and transcriptional silencing. Incubation of drug-sensitive cells in low glucose medium induced the expression of SIRT1 and increased cellular resistance to cisplatin. Reduced SIRT1 expression by a SIRT1 SMART small interfering RNA duplex sensitized the >20-fold resistant CP-r cells to cisplatin treatment 1.5- to 2-fold, and SIRT1 overexpression by SIRT1 cDNA transfection increased cisplatin resistance in cisplatin-sensitive cells by 2- to 3-fold. Our findings therefore suggest that reduced glucose use and altered mitochondrial metabolism mediated by SIRT1 is one of several alterations that contribute to cellular resistance to cisplatin.

2008-08-21,Comparative study of carbon and BN nanographenes: Ground electronic states and energy gap engineering,"The relationship between stabilities and shape configurations of carbon and boron nitride (BN) nanographenes (NGs) was studied at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of rectangular-shaped carbon nanographenes (CNGs) decrease as the graphene sizes increase with a direct inverse dependence on the length of zigzag edge. Due to the double zigzag edge boundaries, the CNGs with long zigzag edges have open-shell singlet ground states; in contrast, the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of BN nanographenes (BNNGs) have a weak dependence with size; all BNNGs have closed-shell singlet ground states, and those with long zigzag edges have slightly larger energy gaps. CNGs with long zigzag edges are less favorable energetically than their structural isomers with long armchair edges, while the BNNGs have the opposite preference. Chemical modifications that change the long zigzag edge into armchair type can efficiently stabilize the kinetically unstable CNGs (with open-shell singlet ground states) and modify their energy gaps. © 2008 American Chemical Society."
2008-08-07,Energetics of endohedral atoms in type-I clathrates observed by soft x-ray spectroscopy,"We present an extensive soft x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study on the core levels of the endohedral atoms of Ba8 Ga16 Ge30 (BGG), Sr8 Ga16 Ge30 (SGG), Eu8 Ga16 Ge30 (EGG), and Sr8 Ga16 Si30 (SGS) single crystals, performed at a high-energy facility. Unexpected features evidencing the different shift for the 2a and 6d sites between Ba4d and Sr3d are observed for BGG and SGG. The detailed analyses including theoretical support by first-principles band-structure calculations lead to the surprising conclusion that the component distributions of the larger tetrakaidecahedral cage are different depending on the endohedral atoms, which is in contrast to the past consensus that BGG and SGG have the same framework structure. The differences are further supported by analysis of the Ga3d core levels. This may suggest thorough reconsiderations on earlier interpretations of experimental data. © 2008 The American Physical Society."
2008-08-04,"Mapping technique for biodistribution of elements in a model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans, after exposure to copper nanoparticles with microbeam synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence","To investigate the toxicological effects of nanomaterials, experimental studies on the absorption and accumulation in organisms are of broad interest. In the present study, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) was used as a ""model"" organism to investigate the bioaccumulation and toxicological effects of engineered copper nanoparticles with a scanning technique of microbeam synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (μ-SRXRF). The adult hermaphrodite is anatomically simple with 959 somatic cells and 1 mm in length. The mapping results of the whole organism indicate that the exposure to copper nanoparticles can result in an obvious elevation of Cu and K levels, and a change of bio-distribution of Cu in nematodes. Accumulation of Cu occurs in the head and at a location 1/3 of the way up the body from the tail compared to the un-exposed control. In contrast, a higher amount of Cu was detected in other portion of worm body, especially in its excretory cells and intestine when exposed to Cu2+. The results compared well with total Cu levels in nematodes, which were 4.10 ± 0.54, 12.32 ± 0.49 and 5.22 ± 0.63 μg g-1 dry weight for the PBS, Cu2+ and Cu nanoparticle groups, respectively, measured by ICP-MS.

2008-08-01,Bio-distribution and metabolic paths of silica coated CdSeS quantum dots,"With the rapid development of quantum dot (QD) technology, water-soluble QDs have the prospect of being used as a biological probe for specific diagnoses, but their biological behaviors in vivo are little known. Our recent in vivo studies concentrated on the bio-kinetics of QDs coated by hydroxyl group modified silica networks (the QDs are 21.3 ± 2.0 nm in diameter and have maximal emission at 570 nm). Male ICR mice were intravenously given the water-soluble QDs with a single dose of 5 nmol/mouse. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry was used to measure the 111Cd content to indicate the concentration of QDs in plasma, organs, and excretion samples collected at predetermined time intervals. Meanwhile, the distribution and aggregation state of QDs in tissues were also investigated by pathological examination and differential centrifugation. The plasma half-life and clearance of QDs were 19.8 ± 3.2 h and 57.3 ± 9.2 ml/h/kg, respectively. The liver and kidney were the main target organs for QDs. The QDs metabolized in three paths depending on their distinct aggregated states in vivo. A fraction of free QDs, maintaining their original form, could be filtered by glomerular capillaries and excreted via urine as small molecules within five days. Most QDs bound to protein and aggregated into larger particles that were metabolized in the liver and excreted via feces in vivo. After five days, 8.6% of the injected dose of aggregated QDs still remained in hepatic tissue and it was difficult for this fraction to clear. © 2008."
2008-07-23,Detection of trace Hg<sup>2+</sup> via induced circular dichroism of DNA wrapped around single-walled carbon nanotubes,"The strongly induced circular dichroism (ICD) signals of DNA wrapped around single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are shown by the Synchrotron Radiation Facility. In solution, trace amounts of Hg ions have a strong affinity to bind the nucleic bases of DNA-SWCNTs via a pseudo-first-order kinetic reaction. The Hg binding to the bases of DNA results in partial DNA disassociation from the SWCNTs. Such disassociation of DNA from the SWCNTs will decrease the coupling effects of the transition dipole moments between DNA and SWCNTs, thus inducing the ICD signal of DNA-SWCNTs to decrease significantly. Herein, the ICD of DNA-SWCNTs is applied to detect the concentration of Hg ions at nM level. Copyright © 2008 American Chemical Society."

2008-05-21,Comparative study of pulmonary responses to nano- and submicron-sized ferric oxide in rats,"Ferric oxide (Fe2O3) nanoparticles are of considerable interest for application in nanotechnology related fields. However, as iron being a highly redox-active transition metal, the safety of iron nanomaterials need to be further studied. In this study, the size, dose and time dependent of Fe2O3 nanoparticle on pulmonary and coagulation system have been studied after intratracheal instillation. The Fe2O3 nanoparticles with mean diameters of 22 and 280 nm, respectively, were intratracheally instilled to male Sprague Dawley rats at low (0.8 mg/kg bw) and high (20 mg/kg bw) doses. The toxic effects were monitored in the post-instilled 1, 7 and 30 days. Our results showed that the Fe2O3 nanoparticle exposure could induce oxidative stress in lung. Alveolar macrophage (AM) over-loading of phagocytosed nanoparticle by high dose treatment had occurred, while the non-phagocytosed particles were found entering into alveolar epithelial in day 1 after exposure. Several inflammatory reactions including inflammatory and immune cells increase, clinical pathological changes: follicular hyperplasia, protein effusion, pulmonary capillary vessel hyperaemia and alveolar lipoproteinosis in lung were observed. The sustain burden of particles in AM and epithelium cells has caused lung emphysema and pro-sign of lung fibrosis. At the post-instilled day 30, the typical coagulation parameters, prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) in blood of low dose 22 nm-Fe2O3 treated rats were significantly longer than the controls. We concluded that both of the two-sized Fe2O3 particle intratracheal exposure could induce lung injury. Comparing with the submicron-sized Fe2O3 particle, the nano-sized Fe2O3 particle may increase microvascular permeability and cell lysis in lung epitheliums and disturb blood coagulation parameters significantly. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The presence of stacking defects has been found to be dominating the branching points in these complex nanostructures. The synergistic effects of the dipolar force and stacking defects in the anisotropic self-assembly process are essential for producing complex nanostructures with multiple generations of branches. The inorganic Au dendrimers may have significant applications in diverse areas including as potent catalysts without a supporting scaffold, templates for the synthesis of other nanomaterials, and potential carriers for specific molecules. The method is also applicable to the fabrication of other noble-metal dendrimers via the stacking-defect-modulated anisotropic self-assembly of nanoparticles."

2008-04-09,The translocation of fullerenic nanoparticles into lysosome via the pathway of clathrin-mediated endocytosis,"Manufactured fullerene nanoparticles easily enter into cells and hence have been rapidly developed for biomedical uses. However, it is generally unknown which route the nanoparticles undergo when crossing cell membranes and where they localize to the intracellular compartments. Herein we have used both microscopic imaging and biological techniques to explore the processes of [C60(C(COOH)2)2]n nanoparticles across cellular membranes and their intracellular translocation in 3T3 L1 and RH-35 living cells. The fullerene nanoparticles are quickly internalized by the cells and then routed to the cytoplasm with punctate localization. Upon entering the cell, they are synchronized to lysosome-like vesicles. The [C 60(C(COOH)2)2]n nanoparticles entering cells are mainly via endocytosis with time-, temperature- and energy-dependent manners. The cellular uptake of [C60(C(COOH) 2)2]n nanoparticles was found to be clathrin-mediated but not caveolae-mediated endocytosis. The endocytosis mechanism and the subcellular target location provide key information for the better understanding and predicting of the biomedical function of fullerene nanoparticles inside cells. © IOP Publishing Ltd."

Least-squares fitting of the X-ray absorption near-edge spectra found that inorganic mercury is the major mercury species in hair samples (91.74%), while inorganic and methyl mercury are both about 50% of total mercury in RBC and serum samples, which is in agreement with the data obtained by acidic extraction, fractionation of Hg2+ and CH3Hg+ and quantification by ICP-MS. Curve-fitting analysis revealed that the Hg-S bond length and coordination number in hair were 0.248 ± 0.002 nm and 3.10, respectively, while the S-Hg bond length and coordination number in hair were 0.236 ± 0.002 nm and 4.05. The Hg-S bond length and coordination number in RBC were 0.251 ± 0.003 nm and 4.09, respectively, while they were 0.228 ± 0.002 nm and 4.08 in serum, respectively. The techniques for speciation, structural and binding information described in this study will find the potential application in similar studies of other elements. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

2008-02-01,Acute toxicological impact of nano- and submicro-scaled zinc oxide powder on healthy adult mice,"In this work, the acute oral toxicity of 20- and 120-nm ZnO powder at doses of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-g/kg body weight was evaluated referred to the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals. As the results, both 20- and 120-nm ZnO belong to non-toxic chemicals according to the Globally Harmonized Classification System (GHS) for the classification of chemicals. The distribution determination showed that Zn was mainly retained in the bone, kidney and pancreas after 20- and 120-nm ZnO administration. However, the results of blood measurement suggest that the increase in blood viscosity could be induced by low and median dose of 20-nm ZnO but high dose of 120-nm ZnO. The pathological examination showed that the 120-nm ZnO treated mice had dose-effect pathological damages in stomach, liver, heart and spleen, whereas, 20-nm ZnO displayed negative dose-effect damages in liver, spleen and pancreas. Therefore, we conclude that the liver, spleen, heart, pancreas and bone are the target organs for 20- and 120-nm ZnO oral exposure. More attention should be paid on the potential toxicity induced by low dose of 20-nm ZnO oral exposure. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."
2008-02-01,Possibilities for global governance of converging technologies,"The convergence of nanotechnology, modern biology, the digital revolution and cognitive sciences will bring about tremendous improvements in transformative tools, generate new products and services, enable opportunities to meet and enhance human potential and social achievements, and in time reshape societal relationships. This paper focuses on the progress made in governance of such converging, emerging technologies and suggests possibilities for a global approach. Specifically, this paper suggests creating a multidisciplinary forum or a consultative coordinating group with members from various countries to address globally governance of converging, emerging technologies. The proposed framework for governance of converging technologies calls for four key functions: supporting the transformative impact of the new technologies; advancing responsible development that includes health, safety and ethical concerns; encouraging national and global partnerships; and establishing commitments to long-term planning and investments centered on human development. Principles of good governance guiding these functions include participation of all those who are forging or affected by the new technologies, transparency of governance strategies, responsibility of each participating stakeholder, and effective strategic planning. Introduction and management of converging technologies must be done with respect for immediate concerns, such as privacy, access to medical advancements, and potential human health effects. At the same time, introduction and management should also be done with respect for longer-term concerns, such as preserving human integrity, dignity and welfare. The suggested governance functions apply to four levels of governance: (a) adapting existing regulations and organizations; (b) establishing new programs, regulations and organizations specifically to handle converging technologies; (c) building capacity for addressing these issues into national policies and institutions; and (d) making international agreements and partnerships. Several possibilities for improving the governance of converging technologies in the global self-regulating ecosystem are recommended: using open-source and incentive-based models, establishing corresponding science and engineering platforms, empowering the stakeholders and promoting partnerships among them, implementing long-term planning that includes international perspectives, and institute voluntary and science-based measures for risk management. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."
2008-01-24,Isomeric and structural impacts on electron acceptability of carbon cages in atom-bridged fullerene dimers,"The electrochemical properties of the carbon-bridged fullerene dimers C121(I), C121(II), C121(III), C131, and C141 were characterized systematically for the first time in this study. Cyclic voltammogram and differential pulse voltammogram analyses revealed that they first underwent three reversible fullerene-unit-based reduction processes where each of the two carbon cages accepted one electron in each step and then possessed a different deep reduction sequence from the fourth to sixth reduction potentials of the fullerene cages. The electronic interactions between cages in the atom-bridged dimers (e.g., C 60-C-C60) were found to be different from those of dimers in which two cages were connected directly. Comparison studies of the redox properties of the five dimers revealed that the C60 dimerization via [5.6]-[6.6] connection influenced the cage electron acceptability much more than that of [5.6]-[5.6] or [6.6]-[6.6] connections and the dimerization with C 70 cages influenced the reduction potentials of dimerized products more potently than that with C60 cages. Further results from controlled potential electrolysis, high-performance liquid chromatography, matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, ultraviolet absorption spectral analyses demonstrated the reduction processes and a dissociation of the dimers based on reductions. The theoretical understanding of the experiments was investigated by using time-dependent density functional calculations for the ionic states of C 121(I, II, III)n- with n = 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. © 2008 American Chemical Society."

Molar ratios of the proteins were calculated by the analytical results and the known sulfur content in proteins. The mobile phase was 0. 1 mol/L Tris-HAc. In order to avoid the polyatomic interferences on the sulfur determination, oxygen was added into the collision cell and reacted with sulfur to form sulfur-oxide ion. Therefore, the intensity of 32S 16O+ represented sulfur content during the measurement. These results were in good agreement with the gravimetric results. The RSDs for the proteins are less than 3% and the detection limits for BSA, SOD and MT-II are 14, 52 and 27 pmol, respectively."
2008-01-01,Rapid translocation and pharmacokinetics of hydroxylated single-walled carbon nanotubes in mice,"Determining the in vivo pharmacological profiles of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is essential for the promising biomedical applications of CNTs, such as drug delivery. Using iodine-131 tracing we studied the fundamental behavior of hydroxylated single-walled CNTs (SWNTols) shortly after they were introduced into the animal body (from 2 min to 1 h) by providing the biodistribution data and pharmacokinetic parameters. The distribution was slightly influenced by injection modes, but in any mode radioactivity was found all over the body within 2 min except brain. Liver, kidneys, stomach and lungs are the target organs with high uptake of SWNTols. The SWNTols content in several tissues, such as heart, lungs, and muscle is positively correlated with its content in the blood, showing clearly that the blood stream brings SWNTols to the whole body. This work presents the initial in vivo behavior of the water-soluble functionalized SWNTs, providing also the basic data to show opportunities and limitations for realization of the CNT-based drug vehicle. © 2008, Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

2007-12-10,Ultrahigh reactivity provokes nanotoxicity: Explanation of oral toxicity of nano-copper particles,"Recently, studies on the biological effects of nanomaterials show signs that some of the manufactured nanoparticles exhibit unexpected toxicity to living organisms. It has previously been reported that the copper particles possess size-depended toxicity. In this paper, we propose that the ultrahigh chemical reactivity of nano-copper results in the specific nanotoxicity which is fully proved by in vitro and in vivo experiment. Using chemical kinetics study (in vitro) and blood gas and plasma electrolytes analysis (in vivo), we found that high reactivity cause the big toxicological difference between small size (23.5 nm) and big size (17 μm). The result is also consistent with biochemistry assay, pathological examination and copper content measurement in renal tissue in vivo. For chemical reactive nanoparticles, metallic nano-copper for instance, both the particles themselves and the resulting product (copper ion) should be fully explored. The nano-copper particles may not compromise the mice directly, however, they lead to the accumulation of excessive alkalescent substance and heavy metal ions (copper ions) culminating the metabolic alkalosis and copper ion overload. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2007-10-18,Switchable semiconductive property of the polyhydroxylated metallofullerene,"The temperature-sensitive property of polyhydroxylated metallofullerene film of Gd@C82(OH)x with special hydroxyl number was studied using synchrotron radiation ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and TEM techniques. From room temperature (RT) to 4 °C the photoelectron onset energy of the spectra of Gd@C82(OH)12 shifted from 1.9 to 0.2 eV, indicating that Gd@C82(OH)12 automatically shifted from insulator at RT to semiconductor at 4 °C. However, this could not be observed for Gd@C82(OH)20. TEM experiments show that the variation of conductivity can be ascribed to formation of a microcrystal under low temperature. The dipole moment induced unique intermolecular interactions and self-assembled microcrystalline structures for Gd@C82(OH12. This may cause reconstruction of the upper valence band formed by π-like electrons as well as the density of states (DOS) around the Fermi level (EF) and reconstruct the deeper valence band formed by σ-like electrons, eventually resulting in a shift to a semiconducting nature. These findings revealed a novel nature for polyhydroxylated Gd@C82(OH)x materials: Their insulating properties can be controllably tuned into semiconducting ones as a function of temperature. © 2007 American Chemical Society."

Some recent data support the concept that the central nervous system (CNS) may be a target for the inhaled fine particulates. This work describes initial observation of the transport of intranasally instilled fine ferric oxide (Fe2O3) particles in animal brain. The iron micro-distribution and chemical state in the mice olfactory bulb and brain stem on day 14 after intranasal instillation of fine Fe2O3 particle (280±80 nm) suspension at a single dose of 40 mg/kg body weight were analyzed by synchrotron radiation x-ray fluorescence and x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). The micro-distribution map of iron in the olfactory bulb and brain stem shows an obvious increase of Fe contents in the olfactory nerve and the trigeminus of brain stem, suggesting that Fe2O3 particles were possibly transported via uptake by sensory nerve endings of the olfactory nerve and trigeminus. The XANES results indicate that the ratios of Fe (III)/Fe (II) were increased in the olfactory bulb and brain stem. The further histopathological observation showed that the neuron fatty degeneration occurred in the CA3 area of hippocampus. Such results imply an adverse impact of inhalation of fine Fe2O3 particles on CNS. © Humana Press Inc. 2007."

An important question is: What does social and ethical research actually mean when it is focussed on technological applications that are largely hypothetical, and a field of science spread out across multiple disciplines and lacking unification? This paper maps early literature in the field of research as a way of answering this question. Our aim is to describe how this field is developing in response to its difficult task, and particularly, to comment on the topics of focus and where there is potential for future development. We present four topical categories, labelled Governance, Perception, Science and Philosophy, and use these as a tool to both map the field and to analyse its development. We find a majority of literature currently focused on issues of governance and perception, and offer suggestions for why this might be so. We then discuss cross-category themes of definition, novelty and interdisciplinarity, highlighting diverse positions and a problematic lack of direct debate. Our conclusion is that the field would benefit from more interaction, cross-referencing and creative research across traditional fields of inquiry. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007."
2007-06-14,"Photochemical and photophysical properties of three carbon-bridged fullerene dimers: C<inf>121</inf> (I, II, III)","The photochemical and photophysical properties of the three C121 isomers (I, II, III) were investigated with MADLI-TOF-MS, UV-vis spectra, fluorescence spectra, absorption spectra of their DMA complexes, and theoretical calculations. The three isomers of C121 (I, II, III) have different stabilities under laser irradiation, but isomer I and isomer II show good stability against the heat-induced conversion between different isomers: No conversion between the isomers was found after heating the mixture of isomer I and isomer II at 353 K for 12 h in Ar atmosphere. The results of UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra indicate that interactions between two C60 moieties of C60=C=C60 in the ground and singlet states are not significant, C121 (I, II, III) behaves as an electron-acceptor similar to C60. These indicate that the formation of the fullerene chain structure (e.g., C60=C=C60) does not disturb the photochemical and photophysical properties of the C60 monomer itself, even that the properties were enhanced by the formation of the polymer. This is significant for the C60 polymer in photochemical or photoelectronic applications in which C60=C=C60 can be an excellent basic unit of polymers. © 2007 American Chemical Society."
2007-03-01,The way of stabilizing non-IPR fullerenes and structural elucidation of C<inf>54</inf>Cl<inf>8</inf>,"Recently, a new non-IPR chlorofullerene C54C18 was isolated experimentally (Science 2004, 304, 699). To explore the ways to stabilize non-IPR fullerenes, the authors studied all of the possible isomers of C54 fullerene and some of the C54Cl8 isomers at PM3, B3LYP/3-21G, and B3LYP/6-31G* levels. Combined with analysis of pentagon distributions, bond resonance energies, and steric strains, C 54:540 with the least number of 5/5 bonds was determined to be the thermodynamically best isomer for the C54Cl8. Based on C54:540, the most probable structure of the experimental C 54Cl8 was elucidated. The results suggested one of the necessary conditions of stabilizing non-IPR fullerenes: chemical derivatizations of either endohedral complexation or exohedral addition need to sufficiently stabilize all of the kinetically unstable 5/5 bonds of the cages. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
2007-01-30,Acute toxicity and biodistribution of different sized titanium dioxide particles in mice after oral administration,"In order to evaluate the toxicity of TiO2 particles, the acute toxicity of nano-sized TiO2 particles (25 and 80 nm) on adult mice was investigated compared with fine TiO2 particles (155 nm). Due to the low toxicity, a fixed large dose of 5 g/kg body weight of TiO2 suspensions was administrated by a single oral gavage according to the OECD procedure. In 2 weeks, TiO2 particles showed no obvious acute toxicity. However, the female mice showed high coefficients of liver in the nano-sized (25 and 80 nm) groups. The changes of serum biochemical parameters (ALT/AST, LDH) and pathology (hydropic degeneration around the central vein and the spotty necrosis of hepatocytes) of liver indicated that the hepatic injury was induced after exposure to mass different-sized TiO2 particles. In addition, the nephrotoxicity like increased BUN level and pathology change of kidneys was also observed in the experimental groups. The significant change of serum LDH and alpha-HBDH in 25 and 80 nm groups showed the myocardial damage compared with the control group. However, there are no abnormal pathology changes in the heart, lung, testicle (ovary), and spleen tissues. Biodistribution experiment showed that TiO2 mainly retained in the liver, spleen, kidneys, and lung tissues, which indicated that TiO2 particles could be transported to other tissues and organs after uptake by gastrointestinal tract. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2007-01-30,Investigation of mercury-containing proteins by enriched stable isotopic tracer and size-exclusion chromatography hyphenated to inductively coupled plasma-isotope dilution mass spectrometry,"In order to investigate trace mercury-containing proteins in maternal rat and their offspring, a method of enriched stable isotopic tracer (196Hg and 198Hg) combined with size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled to inductively coupled plasma-isotope dilution mass spectrometry (ICP-IDMS) was developed. Prior to the analysis, 196Hg- and 198Hg-enriched methylmercury was administrated to the pregnant rats. Then the mercury-containing proteins in serum and brain cytosol of the dam and pup rats were separated by size-exclusion columns and the mercury was detected by ICP-MS. The ICP-MS spectrogram of the tracing samples showed significantly elevated 196Hg and 198Hg isotopic signals compared with the natural ones, indicating that the detection sensitivity could be increased by the tracer method. The contents of mercury in chromatographic fractions of the dam and pup rat brain cytosol were quantitatively estimated by post-column reverse ID-ICP-MS. The quantitative speciation differences of mercury in brain cytosol between the dam and pup rats were observed, indicating that such studies could be useful for toxicological estimation. Additionally, the isotopic ratio measurement of 198Hg/202Hg in the tracing samples could be used to identify the artifact mercury species caused in the analytical procedure. The study demonstrates that the tracer method combined with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ICP-IDMS could provide reliably qualitative and quantitative information on mercury-containing proteins in organisms. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

2007-01-01,Influence of intranasal instilled titanium dioxide nanoparticles on monoaminergic neurotransmitters of female mice at different exposure time,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of intranasal instilling titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles on monoaminergic neurotransmitters at different-time exposure. METHODS: CD female mice were intranasally instilled three different-sized (25 nm, 80 nm and 155 nm) TiO, suspension every other day in a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight. The control group was instilled the same volume of Milli-Q water. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to analyze the titanium contents in murine brain after exposure to TiO2 particles 2 days, 10 days, 20 days and 30 days. The monoaminergic neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA), 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and homovanillic (HVA), were determined by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with electrochemical detector. RESULTS: After exposure to TiO, nanoparticles 10 days, the titanium contents in murine brain were increased, the titanium content in the 25 nm group was up to (1059.3 +/- 293.5) ng/g. In 20 days, the titanium content decreased slowly with the metabolism of titanium in vivo, but it kept at a high level, the content decreased to (654.7 +/- 269.2) ng/g in the 25 nm group. After exposure to TiO2 nanoparticles 30 days, the titanium contents had no obviously change. Because of the accumulation of TiO, in the brain, the contents of NE and 5-HT increased significantly after exposure to 80 nm and 155 nm TiO, nanoparticles 20 days, while the decreased contents of DA, DOPAC, HVA and 5-HIAA were observed. CONCLUSION: The inhaled TiO2 nanoparticles could be translocated to and deposited in murine brain after absorbing by nasal mucosa, and further influence the releases and metabolisms of monoaminergic neurotransmitters in brain."
2007-01-01,Determination of Mercury in Fish by Isotope Dilution Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry,"A method for mild extraction and subsequent determination of total mercury content in fish by isotope dilution inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ID-ICP-MS) has been developed. The errors in the measurement of mercury isotope ratio were discussed. The dead time and mass bias induced by the system of ICP-MS were corrected by the use of lead isotopic certified reference material NIST SRM 981. The established method was validated by determining total mercury content in two certified reference materials, IAEA 436 (Tuna) and NRCC DOLT-3 (Dogfish Liver). The results of total mercury presented in IAEA 436 and DOLT-3 were 4.23 ± 0.06 and 3.33 ± 0.05 mg kg-1, respectively, which were in agreement with the certified values. The extraction method was suitable for the determination of mercury by ID-ICP-MS because the memory effect of mercury in the system could be efficiently eliminated. © 2007 Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences."
2007-01-01,Toxicological and biological effects of nanomaterials,"In this paper, we summarise the most recent findings on the toxicological and biological (including both favourable and adverse) effects of some studied nanomaterials (nanotubes, fullerene, metallofullerenes, their derivatives, and metallic nanoparticles). The dose-dependent, nanosize dependent, nano-structure dependent biological activity in particular nanotoxicity are discussed. Results show that some conventional methodology for assessing the biological activities of bulk materials may not be valid for nanomaterials even though they have the same chemical composition and are in mass basis. Nevertheless, this kind of research is still in its infancy, and many knowledge gaps exist that need to be filled by further studies. On the other hand, we show some intriguing examples that the adverse biological effects of nanomaterials can be reverse-utilised in biomedical fields. For instance, it was found that the 22 nm [Gd@C 82(OH)22]n particles at a very low dose exhibit an anticancer rate of as high as ∼60% in mice. Dose increase of 1 × 10-7 mol/kg results in a 26% increment of anticancer efficiency. These nanoparticles have strong capacity to improve immunity and obstruct tumour invasion towards normal muscle cells but nearly without toxicity in vivo and in vitro. The fullerene derivatives with proper chemical modifications may help realise the dream of tumour chemotherapeutics of high-efficacy and low-toxicity. Copyright © 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."
2007-01-01,What do we know about innovation in nanotechnology? Some propositions about an emerging field between hype and path-dependency,"This contribution formulates a number of propositions about the emergence of novel nanoscience and nanotechnology (N&N). Seeking to complement recent work that aims to define a research agenda and draws on general insights from the innovation literature, this paper aims to synthesize knowledge from innovation-related studies of the N&N field. More specifically, it is suggested that N&N is often misconstrued as either a field of technology or an area of (broadly) converging technologies while evidence to date suggests rather that N&N be considered a set of inter-related and overlapping about not necessarily merging technologies. The role of instrumentation in connecting the various N&N fields is underlined. Finally, the question is raised whether change in N&N tends to be incremental rather than discontinuous, being the result of technological path-dependencies and lock-ins in industry-typical search regimes that are only slowly giving way to more boundary-crossing activities. © 2007 Akadémiai Kiadó."

2006-09-01,"The nano enterprise: A survey of health and safety concerns, considerations, and proposed improvement strategies to reduce potential adverse effects","Nanotechnology is evolving to become a leading industry. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the potential health effects of nanomaterials and its components. This study focuses on the hazards and risks that nanomaterials pose to physical and environmental health together with the risks posed during their manufacture and research. In particular, the authors seek to promote awareness and the need for the adoption of various strategies to minimize the risk of human exposure to nanotechnologies both within and outside the manufacturing enterprise. Information from scientific journals, project studies, environmental and worker-protection agency reports are used as the main source for this study. The six sigma's DMAIC framework, viz. ""define, measure, analyze, improve, and control,"" is used as a guideline for synthesizing information from published literature. Preliminary evidence from experimental research studies indicate the ability of nanomaterials to penetrate and cause damage to human tissues and cells. The susceptibility of the personnel associated during production (those who are more likely to be at risk) has been analyzed to examine considerations and targets, as well as for developing strategies for a continued research framework. Nanotechnology may pose health and environmental hazards unless adequate preventive measures are developed and implemented. Because of the likely unfavorable health effects on individuals conducting experiments and handling nanomaterials, studies that identify the adverse effects of nanotechnology must be conducted at a pace level with the commercialization of nanotechnology. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

This chapter considers whether existing environmental ethics can provide some guidance on these questions. After a brief discussion of the appropriateness of an environmental ethics framework for the task at hand, the chapter identifies a representative environmental ethic and uses it to evaluate four salient issues that emerge from nanotechnology. The discussion is intended both to give an initial theoretical take on nanotechnology from the perspective of environmental ethics and to provide a clear indication of the direction from which environmental resistance might come."
2006-01-01,Progress in governance of converging technologies integrated from the nanoscale,"It is expected that convergence of nanotechnology, modern biology, the digital revolution, and cognitive sciences will bring about tremendous improvements in transformative tools, generate new products and services, enable human personal abilities and social achievements, and in time reshape societal relationships. This article focuses on the progress made in governance of such converging, emerging technologies that are integrated with more traditional technologies. The proposed framework for governance calls for several key functions: supporting the transformative impact; advancing responsible development that includes health, safety, and ethical concerns; encouraging national and global partnerships; and commitment to long-term planning with effects on human development. Principles of good governance include participation of all those involved or affected by the new technologies, transparency, participant responsibility, and effective strategic planning. Introduction and management of converging technologies must be done with respect for immediate concerns (such as information technology privacy, access to medical advancements, and addressing toxicity of new nanomaterials) and longer-term concerns (such as human development and concern for human integrity, dignity, and welfare). Four levels of governance of converging technologies have been identified: (a) adapting existing regulations and organizations; (b) establishing new programs, regulations, and organizations specifically to handle converging technologies; (c) national policies and institutional capacity building; and (d) international agreements and partnerships. © 2006 New York Academy of Sciences."
2005-12-12,Military nanotechnology: Potential applications and preventive arms control,"With revolutionary changes in nanotechnology (NT) now on the horizon, many countries have started major research and development (R&D) programmes, which are mainly civilian. Often overlooked are military R&D programmes - in particular those of the US government. This is the first systematic and comprehensive presentation of the potential military applications of NT. In ten to twenty years, these applications may include extremely small computers, robots, missiles, satellites, launchers and sensors. They may also provide lighter and stronger materials for vehicles and weapons, implants in soldiers' bodies, metal-free firearms, autonomous fighting systems, and smaller chemical and biological weapons. These potential uses raise strong concerns. This assessment is made from a viewpoint of international security, considering the new criteria of dangers for arms control and the international law of warfare, dangers for stability through potential new arms races and proliferation, and dangers for humans and society. Some military applications, such as computers, will be so close to civilian uses that limits are impractical. Others, such as sensors for biological-warfare agents, may contribute to stronger protection against terrorist attacks and better verification of compliance with arms-control treaties. For preventive limitation of these new technologies, specific approaches are proposed that balance positive civilian uses and take into account verification of compliance, with a view to international peace and security, not national military strength. This book will be of great interest to scholars of military technology, non-lethal weapons, disarmament and security studies in general."
2005-12-01,Translocation of inhaled TiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles along olfactory nervous system to brain studied by synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence,"Nanosized TiO2 is widely used for cleaning air, antibacterial and decomposing organic in wastewater for its highly photocatalytic function. TiO2 inhalation via respiratory tracts is the most common route of its exposure in industry and environment. After inhalation by human or rodents, TiO2 can induce inflammation and pulmonary lesions, which was reported to even cause lung cancer by long-term exposure. In this paper, Synchrotron Radiation X-ray Fluorescence was employed to investigate the distribution of TiO2 in the olfactory bulb and brain of mice after inhalation of TiO2 particles suspension. The results showed that TiO2 could enter the olfactory nerve layer (ON), granular cell layer of olfactory bulb (Gro), and olfactory ventricle (OV) and further the hippocampus, thalamus, and CA3 area of the brain through the olfactory nervous system. The distribution area of microsized TiO2 was wider than that of nanosized TiO2."
2005-10-01,Status of study on biological and toxicological effects of nanoscale materials,"Because the physical and chemical properties of nanosized materials mostly differ from the existing microsized materials, their potential impacts on human health and the environment will be topics under the serious discussions in press and in a number of international scientific journals. We analyze and summarize the existing data of the experimental study on the biological activities and adverse effects of nanoscale materials/particles including single wall carbon nanotubes, multi wall carbon nanotubes, titanium oxide and iron powders. Though some biological behaviors of nanoscale materials observed cannot be understood on the basis of the current knowledge, as the existing data are mostly preliminary, it is too early to make some exclusive conclusions on biological activities (or the toxicity) of any of nanoscale materials. The experimental techniques, the current topics, and the future research directions for this new research field are also discussed."
2005-04-01,The promise and threat of nanotechnology: Can environmental ethics guide US?,"The growing presence of the products of nanotechnology in the public domain raises a number of ethical questions. This paper considers whether existing environmental ethics can provide some guidance on these questions. After a brief discussion of the appropriateness of an environmental ethics framework for the task at hand, the paper identifies a representative environmental ethic and uses it to evaluate four salient issues that emerge from nanotechnology. The discussion is intended both to give an initial theoretical take on nanotechnology from the perspective of environmental ethics and to provide a clear indication of the direction from which environmental resistance might come.
