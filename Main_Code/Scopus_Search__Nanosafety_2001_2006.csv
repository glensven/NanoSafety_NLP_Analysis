2006-09-01,"The nano enterprise: A survey of health and safety concerns, considerations, and proposed improvement strategies to reduce potential adverse effects","Nanotechnology is evolving to become a leading industry. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the potential health effects of nanomaterials and its components. This study focuses on the hazards and risks that nanomaterials pose to physical and environmental health together with the risks posed during their manufacture and research. In particular, the authors seek to promote awareness and the need for the adoption of various strategies to minimize the risk of human exposure to nanotechnologies both within and outside the manufacturing enterprise. Information from scientific journals, project studies, environmental and worker-protection agency reports are used as the main source for this study. The six sigma's DMAIC framework, viz. ""define, measure, analyze, improve, and control,"" is used as a guideline for synthesizing information from published literature. Preliminary evidence from experimental research studies indicate the ability of nanomaterials to penetrate and cause damage to human tissues and cells. The susceptibility of the personnel associated during production (those who are more likely to be at risk) has been analyzed to examine considerations and targets, as well as for developing strategies for a continued research framework. Nanotechnology may pose health and environmental hazards unless adequate preventive measures are developed and implemented. Because of the likely unfavorable health effects on individuals conducting experiments and handling nanomaterials, studies that identify the adverse effects of nanotechnology must be conducted at a pace level with the commercialization of nanotechnology. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
2006-01-01,The promise and threat of nanotechnology: Can environmental ethics guide us?,"The growing presence of the products of nanotechnology in the public domain raises a number of ethical questions. This chapter considers whether existing environmental ethics can provide some guidance on these questions. After a brief discussion of the appropriateness of an environmental ethics framework for the task at hand, the chapter identifies a representative environmental ethic and uses it to evaluate four salient issues that emerge from nanotechnology. The discussion is intended both to give an initial theoretical take on nanotechnology from the perspective of environmental ethics and to provide a clear indication of the direction from which environmental resistance might come."
2006-01-01,Progress in governance of converging technologies integrated from the nanoscale,"It is expected that convergence of nanotechnology, modern biology, the digital revolution, and cognitive sciences will bring about tremendous improvements in transformative tools, generate new products and services, enable human personal abilities and social achievements, and in time reshape societal relationships. This article focuses on the progress made in governance of such converging, emerging technologies that are integrated with more traditional technologies. The proposed framework for governance calls for several key functions: supporting the transformative impact; advancing responsible development that includes health, safety, and ethical concerns; encouraging national and global partnerships; and commitment to long-term planning with effects on human development. Principles of good governance include participation of all those involved or affected by the new technologies, transparency, participant responsibility, and effective strategic planning. Introduction and management of converging technologies must be done with respect for immediate concerns (such as information technology privacy, access to medical advancements, and addressing toxicity of new nanomaterials) and longer-term concerns (such as human development and concern for human integrity, dignity, and welfare). Four levels of governance of converging technologies have been identified: (a) adapting existing regulations and organizations; (b) establishing new programs, regulations, and organizations specifically to handle converging technologies; (c) national policies and institutional capacity building; and (d) international agreements and partnerships. © 2006 New York Academy of Sciences."
2005-12-12,Military nanotechnology: Potential applications and preventive arms control,"With revolutionary changes in nanotechnology (NT) now on the horizon, many countries have started major research and development (R&D) programmes, which are mainly civilian. Often overlooked are military R&D programmes - in particular those of the US government. This is the first systematic and comprehensive presentation of the potential military applications of NT. In ten to twenty years, these applications may include extremely small computers, robots, missiles, satellites, launchers and sensors. They may also provide lighter and stronger materials for vehicles and weapons, implants in soldiers' bodies, metal-free firearms, autonomous fighting systems, and smaller chemical and biological weapons. These potential uses raise strong concerns. This assessment is made from a viewpoint of international security, considering the new criteria of dangers for arms control and the international law of warfare, dangers for stability through potential new arms races and proliferation, and dangers for humans and society. Some military applications, such as computers, will be so close to civilian uses that limits are impractical. Others, such as sensors for biological-warfare agents, may contribute to stronger protection against terrorist attacks and better verification of compliance with arms-control treaties. For preventive limitation of these new technologies, specific approaches are proposed that balance positive civilian uses and take into account verification of compliance, with a view to international peace and security, not national military strength. This book will be of great interest to scholars of military technology, non-lethal weapons, disarmament and security studies in general."
2005-12-01,Translocation of inhaled TiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles along olfactory nervous system to brain studied by synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence,"Nanosized TiO2 is widely used for cleaning air, antibacterial and decomposing organic in wastewater for its highly photocatalytic function. TiO2 inhalation via respiratory tracts is the most common route of its exposure in industry and environment. After inhalation by human or rodents, TiO2 can induce inflammation and pulmonary lesions, which was reported to even cause lung cancer by long-term exposure. In this paper, Synchrotron Radiation X-ray Fluorescence was employed to investigate the distribution of TiO2 in the olfactory bulb and brain of mice after inhalation of TiO2 particles suspension. The results showed that TiO2 could enter the olfactory nerve layer (ON), granular cell layer of olfactory bulb (Gro), and olfactory ventricle (OV) and further the hippocampus, thalamus, and CA3 area of the brain through the olfactory nervous system. The distribution area of microsized TiO2 was wider than that of nanosized TiO2."
2005-10-01,Status of study on biological and toxicological effects of nanoscale materials,"Because the physical and chemical properties of nanosized materials mostly differ from the existing microsized materials, their potential impacts on human health and the environment will be topics under the serious discussions in press and in a number of international scientific journals. We analyze and summarize the existing data of the experimental study on the biological activities and adverse effects of nanoscale materials/particles including single wall carbon nanotubes, multi wall carbon nanotubes, titanium oxide and iron powders. Though some biological behaviors of nanoscale materials observed cannot be understood on the basis of the current knowledge, as the existing data are mostly preliminary, it is too early to make some exclusive conclusions on biological activities (or the toxicity) of any of nanoscale materials. The experimental techniques, the current topics, and the future research directions for this new research field are also discussed."
