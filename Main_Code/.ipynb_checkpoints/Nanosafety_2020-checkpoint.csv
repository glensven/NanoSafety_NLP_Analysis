"Relationship between chemical composition and physical State of used nanomaterials in nanotechnology companies with type and prevalance of symptoms of employees of these companies in Tehran, Iran","Background and aims: Decades after the introduction of nanotechnology as a new field of research and production, the speed of development of this field has been remarkable. These advances have enabled nanomaterials to be used in various fields and industries including electronics, optics, consumer goods, production and storage of energy, soil and water conservation, as well as in medicine for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. Worldwide sales of nanomaterials were US $ 22.9 billion in 2013 and with annual growth of 19.8%, it is expected to reach US $ 64.2 billion by the end of 2019. Therefore, many economists consider the production and use of nanomaterials as an integral part of future economic activities. These advances are due to the unique physico-chemical and biological properties of nanoscale materials. The large surface-to-volume ratio and small size and surface characteristics of nanomaterials are the most important physico-chemical properties of them. The specific physico-chemical properties of nanomaterials have led them to show specific behaviors in interaction with biological systems. The most important of these behaviors are moving towards secondary target organs, poor clearance by macrophages, the ability to transmit through the axons of sensory neurons, and to reach intracellular structures such as mitochondria and the nucleus. These properties, in addition to their many applications, have also raised concerns about the potential effects of these substances on human health and the environment. These concerns have generated a large wave of research in the fields of nanomaterials safety, health and toxicology. Forecasts show that the number of staff exposed to nanomaterials will reach about 6 million by the end of 2020. Concerns are increasing day by day as the number of workers exposed to nanomaterials increases. In Iran, more than 200 companies are active in the field of production and using nanomaterials. These companies have received 517 nanoscale certification for their products, until January 2019. Their products are exported to 49 countries and 5 continents worldwide. The increasing growth of these activities in the country necessitates attention to the safety, health and environmental aspects of nanotechnology. According to what was said, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between the symptoms of employees of nanomaterials producing and consuming companies with chemical composition (as a factor affecting the type and severity of effects) and physical state (as an influencing factor on exposure) of the nanomaterials. Methods: The present study is a descriptive cross-sectional study carried out in 2018 among employees of nanotechnology companies in Tehran. Specifications of the companies were provided by correspondence with the Ministry of Industry, Mine & Trade. Of the companies invited, 52 companies agreed to participate in the study. Staff symptoms were assessed using a nonspecific symptoms questionnaire. The questionnaire was designed and validated in a period of two months by a team of 19 experts in the fields of occupational health, occupational medicine, toxicology, medical nanotechnology and health education. The required information about the occupational characteristics, chemical composition and physical state of the nanomaterials used in the companies was also collected using the NanoTool method form. The questionnaire and the form were then emailed to staff exposed to nanomaterials. Staff inclusion criteria were ""to have direct exposure to nanomaterials, that is, to produce or consume nanomaterials during their daily working processes"" and ""to have at least one year of experience"". Of the 52 companies that agreed to participate in the study, 198 completed questionnaires and completed forms were received. Finally, data were analyzed using SPSS.22 software. Frequency distribution tables and Chi-squared test, Fisher exact test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for this purpose. Results: The study of the characteristics of the participants showed that their mean age was 33.76 (SD = 6.108) years; Their average work experience was 6.76 (SD = 5.217) years. Study participants were well educated, with 61.2% having a master's or doctorate degree. 49% (96) of the subjects were men and 51% (100) of them were women. Manufactured/consumed nanomaterials in companies were investigated in similar groups in terms of chemical composition (metal, metal oxide, carbonous and the others) and physical state (dry powder, suspension/ emulsion, paste/gel and the others). The results of investigating the frequency of symptoms of nanotechnology companies’ employees using nonspecific symptoms questionnaire showed that the frequency of some skin symptoms such as ""redness"", ""itching"" and ""roughness"" were 72.7%, 67.2% and 62.6%, respectively. The frequency of some respiratory symptoms were also high; ""cough"" (64.1%), ""sneezing"" (60.6%) and ""sore throat"" (60.1%). High-frequency ocular symptoms included ""eye irritation"" (66.2%), ""itchy eyes"" (28.3%), and ""red eyes"" (25.3%). Investigation of the correlation between the skin symptoms of the employees with the chemical composition and physical state of the nanomaterials used in the companies showed that the symptoms ""skin roughness"", ""skin itching"", ""skin rash"" and ""hair loss"" have significant correlation with the physical state of nanomaterials and ""skin redness"", "" Skin darkness ""and"" skin rash"" have significant relationship with the chemical composition of nanomaterials. Investigation of the relationship between employees' gastrointestinal symptoms with the chemical composition and physical state of the nanomaterials used in the companies showed that the symptoms ""appetite suppression"", ""thirst"", ""nausea/ vomiting"" and ""darkness of stool color"" have significant relationship with the physical state of nanomaterials and ""thirst"", ""Nausea/vomiting"" and ""inability to detect taste"" have significant relationship with the chemical composition of nanomaterials. Evaluation of the relationship between neurological symptoms of staff with the physical state and chemical composition of nanomaterials showed the significant relationship between ""movement problems"" and chemical composition of nanomaterials. Also, ""dizziness"" and ""sleeplessness/ wakefulness"" were significantly associated with both the chemical composition and the physical state of the nanomaterials. Investigating the relationship between the chemical composition and physical state of the nanomaterials with the respiratory symptoms of staff revealed ""shortness of breath"", ""wheezing"", ""chest heaviness"", ""difficult breathing"", ""increased phlegm"" and ""voice change"" significantly correlated with both the chemical composition and the physical state of the nanomaterials. ""Cough"" was also significantly associated with the chemical composition of the nanomaterials. Examination of the correlation between ophthalmic symptoms and chemical composition and physical state of nanomaterials indicated that the symptoms ""blurred vision"" and ""visual impairment"" were significantly correlated with the chemical composition of the nanomaterials. Also, ""increased eye gum"" and ""red eyes"" were significantly associated with both the chemical composition and the physical state of the nanomaterials. Conclusion: Given the frequency of symptoms among staff exposed to nanomaterials, their statistical association with the chemical composition and physical state of nanomaterials, Staff 's attitude toward nanomaterials that are generally considered safe, inadequate and generally inappropriate use of personal protective equipment appropriate to work with nanomaterials and lack of education and training about the effects of nanomaterials on health and the environment, existing these symptoms among the employees of these companies are reasonable and that is an important issue. Therefore, the following are suggested to reduce occupational exposure to nanomaterials: Provide adequate training for the staff of these companies in the areas of basic concepts of nanosafety, standard work procedures when working with nanomaterials, appropriate personal protective equipment for working with nanomaterials and using them properly and waste management of nanomaterials."
Self-Protecting Biomimetic Nanozyme for Selective and Synergistic Clearance of Peripheral Amyloid-β in an Alzheimer's Disease Model,"Clearance of peripheral amyloid-β (Aβ) has been demonstrated to be promising for overcoming the blood-brain barrier (BBB) hurdle to eliminate brain-derived Aβ associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Even so, current developed therapeutic assays for clearance of peripheral Aβ are still facing challenges on how to avoid interference of certain biological molecules and prevent triggering the activation of immune responses and blood clotting. Here, a biomimetic nanozyme (CuxO@EM-K) with augmented protein adsorption resistance, minimized immunogenicity, and enhanced biocompatibility is designed and synthesized. The CuxO@EM-K is made of CuxO nanozyme wrapped with modified 3xTg-AD mouse erythrocyte membrane with Aβ-targeting pentapeptide KLVFF. KLVFF serves as Aβ-specific ligand that works together with erythrocyte membrane to selectively capture Aβ in the blood. Meanwhile, the erythrocyte membrane coating prevents protein coronas formation and thus retains Aβ-targeting ability of CuxO@EM-K in biological fluids. More importantly, the CuxO core with multiple antioxidant enzyme-like activities stabilizes the outer erythrocyte membrane and simultaneously mitigates Aβ-induced membrane oxidative damage, which enables the extended systemic circulation indispensable for adsorbing Aβ. In vivo studies demonstrate that CuxO@EM-K not only reduces Aβ burden in the blood and brain but also ameliorates memory deficits in the widely used 3xTg-AD mouse model. Moreover, CuxO@EM-K shows no apparent toxicity in 3xTg-AD mice. Overall, this work provides an example for developing biocompatible and synergistic clearance of peripheral Aβ associated with AD."

Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles Presenting Programmed Death 1 for Improved Cancer Immunotherapy via Immune Activation and Checkpoint Inhibition,"Natural, extracellular membrane vesicles secreted by Gram-negative bacteria, outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), contain numerous pathogen-associated molecular patterns which can activate systemic immune responses. Previous studies have shown that OMVs induce strong IFN-Î- A nd T cell-mediated anti-tumor effects in mice. However, IFN-γis known to upregulate immunosuppressive factors in the tumor microenvironment, especially the immune checkpoint programmed death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), which may hamper T cell function and limit immunotherapeutic effectiveness. Here, we report the development of genetically engineered OMVs whose surface has been modified by insertion of the ectodomain of programmed death 1 (PD1). This genetic modification does not affect the ability of OMVs to trigger immune activation. More importantly, the engineered OMV-PD1 can bind to PD-L1 on the tumor cell surface and facilitate its internalization and reduction, thereby protecting T cells from the PD1/PD-L1 immune inhibitory axis. Through the combined effects of immune activation and checkpoint suppression, the engineered OMVs drive the accumulation of effector T cells in the tumor, which, in turn, leads to a greater impairment of tumor growth, compared with not only native OMVs but also the commonly used PD-L1 antibody. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the potential of bioengineered OMVs as effective immunotherapeutic agents that can comprehensively regulate the tumor immune microenvironment to effect markedly increased anti-tumor efficacy."
Bright Aggregation-Induced Emission Nanoparticles for Two-Photon Imaging and Localized Compound Therapy of Cancers,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a noninvasive therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment, which always suffers from the low reactive oxygen species (ROS) yield of traditional organic dyes. Herein, we present lipid-encapsulated aggregation-induced emission nanoparticles (AIE NPs) that have a high quantum yield (23%) and a maximum two-photon absorption (TPA) cross-section of 560 GM irradiated by near-infrared light (800 nm). The AIE NPs can serve as imaging agents for spatiotemporal imaging of tumor tissues with a penetration depth up to 505 μm on mice melanoma model. Importantly, the AIE NPs can simultaneously generate singlet oxygen (1O2) and highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (â?¢OH) upon irradiation with 800 nm irradiation for photodynamic tumor ablation. In addition, the AIE NPs can be effectively cleared from the mouse body after the imaging and therapy. This study provides a strategy to develop theranostic agents for cancer image-guided PDT with high brightness, superior photostability, and high biosafety."
Combinatorial miRNA-34a replenishment and irinotecan delivery: Via auto-fluorescent polymeric hybrid micelles for synchronous colorectal cancer theranostics,"The synergistic combination of microRNA (miRNA) modulation and chemotherapy has emerged as an effective strategy to combat cancer. Irinotecan (IRI) is a potent antitumor chemotherapeutic in clinical practice and has been used for treating various malignant tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, IRI is not effective for advanced CRC or metastatic behavior. Herein, novel polymeric hybrid micelles were engineered based on two different amphiphilic copolymers, polyethyleneimine-poly(d,l-lactide) (PEI-PLA) and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy (polyethyleneglycol) (DSPE-PEG), in which IRI and a tumor suppressive microRNA-34a (miR-34a) gene were efficiently co-loaded (MINPs) to achieve a chemo-miRNA combination therapy against CRC. MINPs were successfully constructed by two-step film dispersion and electrostatic interaction methods. IRI and miR-34a could be efficaciously encapsulated as MINPs and transferred to CRC cells. After encapsulation, MINPs would then upregulate miR-34a expression and regulate miR-34a-related downstream genes, which in turn led to enhanced cell cytotoxicity and apoptosis ratios. MINPs presented an excitation-dependent multi-wavelength emission feature due to the intrinstic fluorescence properties of PEI-PLA and could be utilized for in vitro/vivo imaging. According to the in vivo experimental results, MINPs possess the great characteristic of accumulating in situ in a tumor site and lightening it after intravenous administration. Furthermore, MINPs presented extraordinary antitumor efficacy owing to the combined therapy effects of IRI and miR-34a with good biocompability. Overall, our findings validated MINPs-mediated miR-34a replenishment and IRI co-delivery to serve as an effective theranostic platform and provided an innovative horizon for combining chemo-gene therapy against CRC."
"Bi<sup>3+</sup>-Doped BaYF<inf>5</inf>:Yb,Er Upconversion Nanoparticles with Enhanced Luminescence and Application Case for X-ray Computed Tomography Imaging","In this work, BaYF5:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+/x%Bi3+ (abbreviated as BaYF5:Yb,Er,Bix, where x = 0-3.0) upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) with various doping concentrations of Bi3+ were synthesized through a simple hydrothermal method. The influence of the doping amount of Bi3+ on the microstructures and upconversion luminescence (UCL) properties of the BaYF5:Yb,Er,Bix UCNPs was studied in detail. The doping concentration of Bi3+ has little influence on the microstructures of the UCNPs but significantly impacts their UCL intensities. Under excitation of a 980 nm near-IR laser, the observed UCL intensities for the BaYF5:Yb,Er,Bix UCNPs display first an increasing trend and then a decreasing trend with an increase in the ratio x, giving a maximum at x = 2.5. A possible energy-transfer process and simplified energy levels of the BaYF5:Yb,Er,Bix UCNPs were proposed. The potential of the BaYF5:Yb,Er,Bix UCNPs as contrast agents for computerized tomography (CT) imaging was successfully demonstrated. An obvious accumulation of BaYF5:Yb,Er,Bix in tumor sites was achieved because of high passive targeting by the enhanced permeability and retention effect and relatively low uptake by a reticuloendothelial system such as liver and spleen. This work paves a new route for the design of luminescence-enhanced UNCPs as promising bioimaging agents for cancer theranostics."
"Activating the Antibacterial Effect of 4,6-Diamino-2-pyrimidinethiol-Modified Gold Nanoparticles by Reducing their Sizes","Adequately decorated gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have excellent antibiotic activities against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. Nanoparticles exhibiting Gram selective antibacterial actions are beneficial to precise therapy. Here, we present a strategy to tune the antibacterial spectrum of a small molecule (4,6-diamino-2-pyrimidinethiol, DAPT)-modified GNPs (DAPT-GNPs, DGNPs) by adjusting their sizes. Compared to large (ca. 14 nm diameter) DGNPs (lDGNPs) and medium-sized (3–4 nm diameter) DGNPs (mDGNPs), which have no antibacterial effect or only target Gram-negative (G−) bacteria, ultrasmall DGNPs (uDGNPs, <2 nm) have a broad antibacterial spectrum, especially showing an over 60-fold increase in antibacterial efficacy against Gram-positive (G+) bacteria. Moreover, the uDGNPs-functionalized scaffolds (agarose gel) can serve as general wound dressings for healing burnt infections. Our strategy is insightful for exploring properties of the nanomaterials and their applications."
"Perspective: The Lung, Particles, Fibers, Nanomaterials, and Autoimmunity","Studies have shown that a wide range of factors including drugs, chemicals, microbes, and other environmental agents can induce pre-clinical autoimmunity. However, only a few have been confidently linked to autoimmune diseases. Among these are exposures to inhaled particulates that are known to be associated with autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. In this article, the potential of particle, fiber, and nanomaterial exposures to induce autoimmunity is discussed. It is hypothesized that inhalation of particulate material known to be associated with human autoimmune diseases, such as cigarette smoke and crystalline silica, results in a complex interplay of a number of pathological processes, including, toxicity, oxidative stress, cell and tissue damage, chronic inflammation, post-translational modification of self-antigens, and the formation of lymphoid follicles that provide a milieu for the accumulation of autoreactive B and T cells necessary for the development and persistence of autoimmune responses, leading to disease. Although experimental studies show nanomaterials are capable of inducing several of the above features, there is no evidence that this matures to autoimmune disease. The procession of events hypothesized here provides a foundation from which to pursue experimental studies to determine the potential of other environmental exposures to induce autoimmunity and autoimmune disease."
"Supernucleation, crystalline structure and thermal stability of bacterially synthesized poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) polyester tailored by thymine as a biocompatible nucleating agent","Naturally occurring thymine (TM) was incorporated into bacterial poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) polyester to fabricate a novel and green biocomposite. Both 0.5% and 1% TM exhibit supernucleation effect on PHB, and crystallization kinetics suggests TM significantly increased Tc and Xc, and substantially shortened t1/2 of PHB. Epitaxial nucleation caused by a perfect crystal lattice matching between PHB and TM, was proposed to elucidate nucleation mechanism of PHB. Hydrogen bond interaction exists between C[dbnd]O, C–O–C groups of PHB and –CH3 (or –CH)/–NH– group of TM. TM interacted with C[dbnd]O group of PHB crystalline phase rather than that of amorphous one. In addition, two new IR crystalline bands assigned to C–O–C group of PHB appeared in the presence of TM, which arises from shift of two amorphous ones, respectively. TM enhanced onset thermal degradation temperature of PHB, mainly attributed to increased degree of crystallinity of PHB and flame retardance effect of TM."
Disentangling Biomolecular Corona Interactions With Cell Receptors and Implications for Targeting of Nanomedicines,"Nanoparticles are promising tools for nanomedicine in a wide array of therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Yet, despite the advances in the biomedical applications of nanomaterials, relatively few nanomedicines made it to the clinics. The formation of the biomolecular corona on the surface of nanoparticles has been known as one of the challenges toward successful targeting of nanomedicines. This adsorbed protein layer can mask targeting moieties and creates a new biological identity that critically affects the subsequent biological interactions of nanomedicines with cells. Extensive studies have been directed toward understanding the characteristics of this layer of biomolecules and its implications for nanomedicine outcomes at cell and organism levels, yet several aspects are still poorly understood. One aspect that still requires further insights is how the biomolecular corona interacts with and is “read” by the cellular machinery. Within this context, this review is focused on the current understanding of the interactions of the biomolecular corona with cell receptors. First, we address the importance and the role of receptors in the uptake of nanoparticles. Second, we discuss the recent advances and techniques in characterizing and identifying biomolecular corona-receptor interactions. Additionally, we present how we can exploit the knowledge of corona-cell receptor interactions to discover novel receptors for targeting of nanocarriers. Finally, we conclude this review with an outlook on possible future perspectives in the field. A better understanding of the first interactions of nanomaterials with cells, and -in particular -the receptors interacting with the biomolecular corona and involved in nanoparticle uptake, will help for the successful design of nanomedicines for targeted delivery."
Polysaccharide-Based Nanomaterials for Ocular Drug Delivery: A Perspective,"Ocular drug delivery is one of the most challenging issues in ophthalmology because of the complex physiological structure of the eye. Polysaccharide-based nanomaterials have been extensively investigated in recent years as ideal carriers for enhancing the bioavailability of drugs in the ocular system because of their biocompatibility and drug solubilization. From this perspective, we discuss the structural instability of polysaccharides and its impact on the synthesis process; examine the potential for developing bioactive polysaccharide-based ocular drug nanocarriers; propose four strategies for designing novel drug delivery nanomaterials; and suggest reviewing the behavior of nanomaterials in ocular tissues."
"Elucidating the origin of the surface functionalization - dependent bacterial toxicity of graphene nanomaterials: Oxidative damage, physical disruption, and cell autolysis","Previous studies have shown that the toxicity of graphene nanomaterials (GNMs) to bacteria are related to the surface functionalization, however, the involved mechanisms are not fully understood. The present study aims to explore the toxic mechanisms of differentially functionalized GNMs to bacteria from the aspects of physical interaction, oxidative damage and cell autolysis. Three basic functionalization of GNMs including carboxylation (G-COOH), hydroxylation (G-OH) and amination (G-NH2) were studied. G-COOH (66% viability vs CT group) and G-OH (54%) graphene showed higher toxicity to E. coli than G-NH2 (96%) within 3 h at a concentration of 50 mg/L. The three materials showed distinct physical interaction modes with bacterial cells. G-COOH and G-OH contact with cell membrane via their sharp edges thus causing more damage than G-NH2 which covered the bacteria attaching along the basal plane. The three GNMs showed similar radical generation capacities, thus the direct generation of radicals is not the mechanism causing the toxicity. Instead, the GNMs can oxidize the cellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) thereby causing oxidative damage. The oxidative capacity follows the order: G-COOH > G-OH > G-NH2, which correlated with the antibacterial activity. Cell autolysis, the degradation of cell wall component peptidoglycan, was found to be a new mechanism inducing the death of bacteria. G-COOH and G-OH caused more cell autolysis than G-NH2, which accounts partially for the different toxicity of the three GNMs. The findings provide significant insights into the mechanism of GNMs toxicity to bacteria for not only the risk assessment of GNMs but also the design of graphene based antibacterial materials."
Engineering the Protein Corona Structure on Gold Nanoclusters Enables Red-Shifted Emissions in the Second Near-infrared Window for Gastrointestinal Imaging,"The application of NIR-II emitters for gastrointestinal (GI) tract imaging remains challenging due to fluorescence quenching in the digestive microenvironment. Herein, we report that red-shifting of the fluorescence emission of Au nanoclusters (AuNCs) into NIR-II region with improved quantum yields (QY) could be achieved by engineering a protein corona structure consisting of a ribonuclease-A (RNase-A) on the particle surfaces. RNase-A-encapsulated AuNCs (RNase-A@AuNCs) displayed emissions at 1050 nm with a 1.9 % QY. Compared to rare earth and silver-based NIR-II emitters, RNase-A@AuNCs had excellent biocompatibility, showing >50-fold higher sensitivity in GI tract, and migrated homogenously during gastrointestinal peristalsis to allow visualization of the detailed structures of the GI tract. RNase-A@AuNCs could successfully examine intestinal tumor mice from healthy mice, indicating a potential utility for early diagnosis of intestinal tumors."
The impact of nanoparticles on innate immune activation by live bacteria,"The innate immune system evolved to detect and react against potential dangers such as bacteria, viruses, and environmental particles. The advent of modern technology has exposed innate immune cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, to a relatively novel type of particulate matter, i.e., engineered nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are not inherently pathogenic, and yet cases have been described in which specific nanoparticle types can either induce innate/inflammatory responses or modulate the activity of activated innate cells. Many of these studies rely upon activation by agonists of toll-like receptors, such as lipopolysaccharide or peptidoglycan, instead of the more realistic stimulation by whole live organisms. In this review we examine and discuss the effects of nanoparticles on innate immune cells activated by live bacteria. We focus in particular on how nanoparticles may interfere with bacterial processes in the context of innate activation, and confine our scope to the effects due to particles themselves, rather than to molecules adsorbed on the particle surface. Finally, we examine the long-lasting consequences of coexposure to nanoparticles and bacteria, in terms of potential microbiome alterations and innate immune memory, and address nanoparticle-based vaccine strategies against bacterial infection."
Management of occupational risk prevention of nanomaterials manufactured in construction sites in the eu,"Currently, nanotechnology plays a key role for technological innovation, including the construction sector. An exponential increase is expected in its application, although this has been hampered by the current degree of uncertainty regarding the potential effects of nanomaterials on both human health and the environment. The accidents, illnesses, and disease related to the use of nanoproducts in the construction sector are difficult to identify. For this purpose, this work analyzes in depth the products included in recognized inventories and the safety data sheets of these construction products. Based on this analysis, a review of the recommendations on the use of manufactured nanomaterials at construction sites is performed. Finally, a protocol is proposed with the aim of it serving as a tool for technicians in decision-making management at construction sites related to the use of manufactured nanomaterials. This proposed protocol should be an adaptive and flexible tool while the manufactured nanomaterials-based work continues to be considered as an “emerging risk,” despite the expectation that the protocol will be useful for the development of new laws and recommendations for occupational risk prevention management."
Nanomaterials for Therapeutic RNA Delivery,"Recent years have witnessed tremendous developments and breakthroughs in the field of RNA-based therapeutics. The distinct mechanisms of exogenous RNAs and analogs, including messenger RNAs, small interfering RNAs, microRNAs, and antisense oligonucleotides, have brought them unprecedented potential to treat a variety of pathological conditions. However, the widespread application of RNA therapeutics is hampered by their intrinsic features (e.g., instability, large size, and dense negative charge) and formidable host barriers. Development of safe and efficient vectors is key for successful delivery and translation of RNA therapeutics. In this review, we first present an overview of RNA therapeutics and their clinical translation. We then discuss their delivery challenges and highlight recent advances in nanomaterial-based RNA-delivery platforms. Finally, the potential concerns and future developments of RNA delivery systems are discussed."
"Assessing the nanotechnology on the grounds of costs, benefits, and risks","Background: The technical innovations are based on the principles of science with the assurance of outweighing their cost and risk factors with the benefits to society. But sometimes, the innovation either itself becomes a risk or brings in some risk factors along with it. For most of the alleyway of an innovation from its emergence to its road to societal acceptance and adoption, the focus remains on the benefits majorly. Only when we are at the neck of the hour we think about some of the apparent cost and risk issues. The understanding, proper communication, and address of the basics of risk factors are necessarily required much in advance to deal with this issue. Main body: Nanoparticles with very small size and huge surface area are being derived from various plants, microbes, chemical compounds, metals, and metal alloys. Without our realizations, nanotechnology has become a vital part of our day-to-day life, and nanoparticles are proving their worth in almost every field ranging from food, water, medicine, agriculture, construction, fashion, electronics, and computers to eco-remediation, but what about the costs involved and the risks associated? We strongly need to recognize these concerns and challenges, and it requires collaborative efforts from academicians, researchers, industries, government, and non-government organizations to involve people in dialogs to deal with them. Conclusion: Through reviewing various studies and articles on nanotechnology, this review has shown that nanotechnology can productively be used to produce consumer goods for pharma, electronics, food, agriculture, aviation, construction, security, and remediation sectors which are advantages in their characteristics. Regarding the future of nanotechnology, we need to focus on assessment and management of risks associated for its promising market growth. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]"
SERS-active MIL-100(Fe) sensor for sensitive detection of organic dyes and its enhancement mechanism study,"Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) has been considered as an ideal molecular capture material and has been widely used in many fields, including storage, catalytic, drug delivery and molecular separation due to its unique porous structure. MOFs contain organic linkers and metallic nodes, in which the aromatic ligands of MOFs have a strong π-π interaction with the aromatic structure of many organics, and the metal nodes are conducive to the coordination adsorption of the polarized parts of the molecule. Therefore, MOFs has a broad application prospect in the molecular detection field. Especially in recent years, researchers have continuously reported a series of SERS-active MOFs, which enriches the scope of metal-free semiconductor SERS platforms. In this study, MIL-100(Fe) was synthesized via hydrothermal method following the reported procedure with slight modifications, and then was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and porosity analyzer. Upon the adsorption of methyl blue (MB) and methylene orange (MO) onto MIL-100(Fe), different adsorption capability of MIL-100(Fe) to dyes were observed from their adsorption behavior curves. We found for the first time that MIL-100(Fe) can serve as an ideal SERS-active substrate for the capture and recognition of MB and MO but with different detection limits, 10-7 mol/L for MB and 10-5 mol/L for MO, respectively, indicating MIL-100(Fe) presents selective enhancement properties for these two organic dye molecules. In order to further increase the sensitivity of MIL-100(Fe) substrate for MO detection, the detection has been accomplished by depositing concentrated gold nanoparticle colloid onto the MIL-100(Fe) substrate, thus forming SERS ""hot spots"" which enable amplify the Raman signal of MO due to the electromagnetic enhancement (EM) effect. Density functional theory (DFT) was carried out to evaluate the binding position, molecular distance, binding energy and energy gap between dyes molecules and MIL-100(Fe). The energy gap between the MB and MIL-100(Fe) levels is 1.59 eV, close to the laser excitation energy (EL=1.58 eV). This resonance suggests that the chemical enhancement (CE) mechanism may be operating, accounting for the high SERS activity of MIL-100(Fe) in MB detection. In addition, the adsorption energy between MB and MIL-100(Fe) is stronger than that of MO, this together with the CE accounts for the selective enhancing effect of MIL-100(Fe) on the two dye molecules."
Can an inchi for nano address the need for a simplified representation of complex nanomaterials across experimental and nanoinformatics studies?,"Chemoinformatics has developed efficient ways of representing chemical structures for small molecules as simple text strings, simplified molecular‐input line‐entry system (SMILES) and the IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI), which are machine‐readable. In particular, InChIs have been extended to encode formalized representations of mixtures and reactions, and work is ongoing to represent polymers and other macromolecules in this way. The next frontier is encoding the multi‐component structures of nanomaterials (NMs) in a machine‐readable format to enable linking of datasets for nanoinformatics and regulatory applications. A workshop organized by the H2020 research infrastructure NanoCommons and the nanoinformatics project NanoSolveIT analyzed issues involved in developing an InChI for NMs (NInChI). The layers needed to capture NM structures include but are not limited to: core composition (possibly multi‐layered); surface topography; surface coatings or functionalization; doping with other chemicals; and representation of impurities. NM distributions (size, shape, composition, surface properties, etc.), types of chemical linkages connecting surface functionalization and coating molecules to the core, and various crystallographic forms exhibited by NMs also need to be considered. Six case studies were conducted to elucidate requirements for unambiguous description of NMs. The suggested NInChI layers are intended to stimulate further analysis that will lead to the first version of a “nano” extension to the InChI standard."
Subtoxic cell responses to silica particles with different size and shape,"Health risks from particles are a priority challenge to health protection at work. Despite the ubiquitous exposure to a wide range of particles and the many years of research in this field, there are fundamental unresolved questions regarding the prevention of particle-related respiratory diseases. Here, the highly relevant particulate material silicon dioxide was analyzed with emphasis on defined size and shape. Silica particles were prepared with different size and shape: Spheres (NS nanospheres 60 nm; SMS submicrospheres 230 nm; MS microspheres 430 nm) and rods (SMR submicrorods with d = 125 nm, L = 230 nm; aspect ratio 1:1.8; MR microrods with d = 100 nm, L = 600 nm; aspect ratio 1:6). After an in-depth physicochemical characterization, their effects on NR8383 alveolar macrophages were investigated. The particles were X-ray amorphous, well dispersed, and not agglomerated. Toxic effects were only observed at high concentrations, i.e. ≥ 200 µg mL−1, with the microparticles showing a stronger significant effect on toxicity (MS≈MR > SMR≈SMS≈NS) than the nanoparticles. Special attention was directed to effects in the subtoxic range (less than 50% cell death compared to untreated cells), i.e. below 100 µg mL−1 where chronic health effects may be expected. All particles were readily taken up by NR8383 cells within a few hours and mainly found associated with endolysosomes. At subtoxic levels, neither particle type induced strongly adverse effects, as probed by viability tests, detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein microarrays, and cytokine release (IL-1β, GDF-15, TNF-α, CXCL1). In the particle-induced cell migration assay (PICMA) with leukocytes (dHL-60 cells) and in cytokine release assays, only small effects were seen. In conclusion, at subtoxic concentrations, where chronic health effects may be expected, neither size and nor shape of the synthesized chemically identical silica particles showed harmful cell-biological effects."
Epigenetics in breast cancer therapy—New strategies and future nanomedicine perspectives,"Epigenetic dysregulation has been recognized as a critical factor contributing to the development of resistance against standard chemotherapy and to breast cancer progression via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Although the efficacy of the first-generation epigenetic drugs (epi-drugs) in solid tumor management has been disappointing, there is an increasing body of evidence showing that epigenome modulation, in synergy with other therapeutic approaches, could play an important role in cancer treatment, reversing acquired therapy resistance. However, the epigenetic therapy of solid malignancies is not straightforward. The emergence of nanotechnologies applied to medicine has brought new opportunities to advance the targeted delivery of epi-drugs while improving their stability and solubility, and minimizing off-target effects. Furthermore, the omics technologies, as powerful molecular epidemiology screening tools, enable new diagnostic and prognostic epigenetic biomarker identification, allowing for patient stratification and tailored management. In combination with new-generation epi-drugs, nanomedicine can help to overcome low therapeutic efficacy in treatment-resistant tumors. This review provides an overview of ongoing clinical trials focusing on combination therapies employing epi-drugs for breast cancer treatment and summarizes the latest nano-based targeted delivery approaches for epi-drugs. Moreover, it highlights the current limitations and obstacles associated with applying these experimental strategies in the clinics."
Physicochemical characterization and genotoxicity of the broad class of carbon nanotubes and nanofibers used or produced in U.S. facilities,"Background: Carbon nanotubes and nanofibers (CNT/F) have known toxicity but simultaneous comparative studies of the broad material class, especially those with a larger diameter, with computational analyses linking toxicity to their fundamental material characteristics was lacking. It was unclear if all CNT/F confer similar toxicity, in particular, genotoxicity. Nine CNT/F (MW #1–7 and CNF #1–2), commonly found in exposure assessment studies of U.S. facilities, were evaluated with reported diameters ranging from 6 to 150 nm. All materials were extensively characterized to include distributions of physical dimensions and prevalence of bundled agglomerates. Human bronchial epithelial cells were exposed to the nine CNT/F (0–24 μg/ml) to determine cell viability, inflammation, cellular oxidative stress, micronuclei formation, and DNA double-strand breakage. Computational modeling was used to understand various permutations of physicochemical characteristics and toxicity outcomes. Results: Analyses of the CNT/F physicochemical characteristics illustrate that using detailed distributions of physical dimensions provided a more consistent grouping of CNT/F compared to using particle dimension means alone. In fact, analysis of binning of nominal tube physical dimensions alone produced a similar grouping as all characterization parameters together. All materials induced epithelial cell toxicity and micronuclei formation within the dose range tested. Cellular oxidative stress, DNA double strand breaks, and micronuclei formation consistently clustered together and with larger physical CNT/F dimensions and agglomerate characteristics but were distinct from inflammatory protein changes. Larger nominal tube diameters, greater lengths, and bundled agglomerate characteristics were associated with greater severity of effect. The portion of tubes with greater nominal length and larger diameters within a sample was not the majority in number, meaning a smaller percentage of tubes with these characteristics was sufficient to increase toxicity. Many of the traditional physicochemical characteristics including surface area, density, impurities, and dustiness did not cluster with the toxicity outcomes. Conclusion: Distributions of physical dimensions provided more consistent grouping of CNT/F with respect to toxicity outcomes compared to means only. All CNT/F induced some level of genotoxicity in human epithelial cells. The severity of toxicity was dependent on the sample containing a proportion of tubes with greater nominal lengths and diameters."
Engineering the Nucleophilic Active Oxygen Species in CuTiO<inf>x</inf>for Efficient Low-Temperature Propene Combustion,"Industrialization has resulted in the rapid increase of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, which have caused serious issues to human health and the environment. In this study, an extensive Cu incorporating TiO2 induced nucleophilic oxygen structure was constructed in the CuTiOx catalyst, which exhibited superior low-Temperature catalytic activity for C3H6 combustion. Thorough structural, surface characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the Cu-O-Ti hybridization induced nucleophilic oxygen initiates C3H6 combustion by abstracting the C-H bond. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) results indicated that incorporated copper species acted as the major adsorbent site for the propene molecule. In combination of the DRIFTS and DFT results, the promotion effect of the nucleophilic O on the C-H bond abstraction and CO2 formation pathway was proposed. The surface doping induced nucleophilic oxygen as strong Brønsted basic sites for low-Temperature propene combustion exemplified an efficient strategy for rational design of next-generation environmental catalysts."
Ceo<inf>2</inf> nanomaterials from diesel engine exhaust induce dna damage and oxidative stress in human and rat sperm in vitro,"Cerium dioxide nanomaterials (CeO2 NMs) are widely used in nano-based diesel additives to decrease the emission of toxic compounds, but they have been shown to increase the emission of ultrafine particles as well as the amount of released Ce. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development included CeO2 NMs in the priority list of nanomaterials that require urgent evaluation, and the potential hazard of aged CeO2 NM exposure remains unexplored. Herein, human and rat sperm cells were exposed in vitro to a CeO2 NM-based diesel additive (called Envirox™), burned at 850◦C to mimic its release after combustion in a diesel engine. We demonstrated significant DNA damage after in vitro exposure to the lowest tested concentration (1 µg·L−1) using the alkaline comet assay (ACA). We also showed a significant increase in oxidative stress in human sperm after in vitro exposure to 1 µg·L−1 aged CeO2 NMs evaluated by the H2DCF-DA probe. Electron microscopy showed no internalization of aged CeO2 NMs in human sperm but an affinity for the head plasma membrane. The results obtained in this study provide some insight on the complex cellular mechanisms by which aged CeO2 NMs could exert in vitro biological effects on human spermatozoa and generate ROS."
Defect-Rich Adhesive Molybdenum Disulfide/rGO Vertical Heterostructures with Enhanced Nanozyme Activity for Smart Bacterial Killing Application,"Nanomaterials with intrinsic enzyme-like activities, namely “nanozymes,” are showing increasing potential as a new type of broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, their feasibility is still far from satisfactory, due to their low catalytic activity, poor bacterial capturing capacity, and complicated material design. Herein, a facile synthesis of a defect-rich adhesive molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)/rGO vertical heterostructure (VHS) through a one-step microwave-assisted hydrothermal method is reported. This simple, convenient but effective method for rapid material synthesis enables extremely uniform and well-dispersed MoS2/rGO VHS with abundant S and Mo vacancies and rough surface, for a performance approaching the requirements of practical application. It is demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that the as-prepared MoS2/rGO VHS possesses defect and irradiation dual-enhanced triple enzyme-like activities (oxidase, peroxidase, and catalase) for promoting free-radical generation, owing to much more active edge sites exposure. Meanwhile, the VHS-achieved rough surface exhibits excellent capacity for bacterial capture, with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) destruction through local topological interactions. As a result, optimized efficacy against drug-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria can be explored by such defect-rich adhesive nanozymes, demonstrating a simple but powerful way to engineered nanozymes for alternative antibiotics."
Evolution of biobased and nanotechnology packaging - A review,"This review deals with the evolution of bio-based packaging and the emergence of various nanotechnologies for primary food packaging. The end-of life issues of packaging is discussed and particularly the environmental problems associated with microplastics in the marine environment, which serve as a vector for the assimilation of persistent organic pollutants in the oceans and are transported into the food chain via marine and wild life. The use of biodegradable polymers has been a primary route to alleviate these environmental problems, but for various reasons the market has not developed at a sufficient pace that would cope with the mentioned environmental issues. Currently, the biodegradable plastics only constitute a small fraction of the fossil-based plastic market. Fossil-based plastics are, however, indispensable for food safety and minimization of food waste, and are not only cheap, but has generally more suitable mechanical and barrier properties compared to biodegradable polymers. More recently, various nanotechnologies such as the use of nanoclays, nanocellulose, layer-by-layer technologies and polyelectrolyte complexes have emerged as viable technologies to make oxygen and water vapor barriers suitable for food packaging. These technological developments are highlighted as well as issues like biodegradation, recycling, legislation issues and safety and toxicity of these nanotechnologies."
Proton-driven transformable nanovaccine for cancer immunotherapy,"Cancer vaccines hold great promise for improved cancer treatment. However, endosomal trapping and low immunogenicity of tumour antigens usually limit the efficiency of vaccination strategies. Here, we present a proton-driven nanotransformer-based vaccine, comprising a polymer–peptide conjugate-based nanotransformer and loaded antigenic peptide. The nanotransformer-based vaccine induces a strong immune response without substantial systemic toxicity. In the acidic endosomal environment, the nanotransformer-based vaccine undergoes a dramatic morphological change from nanospheres (about 100 nanometres in diameter) into nanosheets (several micrometres in length or width), which mechanically disrupts the endosomal membrane and directly delivers the antigenic peptide into the cytoplasm. The re-assembled nanosheets also boost tumour immunity via activation of specific inflammation pathways. The nanotransformer-based vaccine effectively inhibits tumour growth in the B16F10-OVA and human papilloma virus-E6/E7 tumour models in mice. Moreover, combining the nanotransformer-based vaccine with anti-PD-L1 antibodies results in over 83 days of survival and in about half of the mice produces complete tumour regression in the B16F10 model. This proton-driven transformable nanovaccine offers a robust and safe strategy for cancer immunotherapy."
"Progress, challenges, and future of nanomedicine","Nanotherapeutics exhibit unique advantages in clinical outcomes compared with conventional small molecular drugs. The past three decades have seen intensive research in the field of nanomedicine, leading to a large number of nanomedical products commercialized globally as well as a pipeline of candidates being translated. However, the development of nanomedicine still faces poor efficacy in many applications. The key to advance the field is a deep understanding of the current barriers, addressable challenges, and future demands. Herein, we first present an overview of the more conventional nanotherapeutics that have been widely investigated so far. This is accompanied by a discussion of the next-generation precision and high-efficient nanotherapeutics, exemplified by functional nanodrugs with enhanced passive targeting, active targeting, and stimuli responsiveness. Next, we emphasize the importance of translating nanomedicine research from bench to bed, detailing issues of safety evaluation, biological fate, manufacturing, cost, and regulatory hurdles. Finally, we provide our perspectives on the challenges and opportunities awaiting scientists to advance this exciting field."
Metal-organic framework-based nanocatalytic medicine for chemodynamic therapy,
"Correction to: Protein-bound calcium phosphate in uremic rat serum: a quantitative study (JBIC Journal of Biological Inorganic Chemistry, (2020), 25, 8, (1051-1063), 10.1007/s00775-020-01807-x)","In the original article, few equations and units were published incorrectly."
Safety-by-design as a governance problem,"Developments in nanotechnology oblige technology regulators and other stakeholders to manage unfamiliar and unpredictable human health and environmental risks. When technological achievement stretches the limits of understanding of risk and safety, the desire to ensure protection can produce unnecessarily prohibitive and costly regulatory policy. This lack of knowledge, referred within this paper as ‘governance gaps,’ requires safety-by-design to overcome lingering governance challenges. However, the fundamentals of safety-by-design are not developed. We propose translating the methodological framing of safety-by-design and related nanotechnology risk governance into a mathematical framing of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to illustrate how safety-by-design might be operationalized. This framing provides a more thorough understanding of technology governance gaps and can help focusing technology development on implementable and safe alternatives. Ultimately, addressing each governance gap can help technology development and technology risk governance keep pace with one another, thereby allowing innovation to flourish while protecting society from undue risks."
Potassium bromate cytotoxicity in the Wister rat model of chronic gastric ulcers: Possible reversal by protocatechuic acid,"The interaction between ingested xenobiotics and the gastrointestinal epithelium influences the possibility of gut epithelial cytotoxicity and systemic toxicity. Potassium bromate (KBrO3) has been shown to perturb the central nervous system and it may be carcinogenic, albeit it is used as a food additive. This highlights the need to understand KBrO3’s effect on the stomach epithelium. Here, we report the cytotoxic potential of KBrO3 in an ulcerated stomach, as well as possible cytoprotection by the polyphenol ‒ protocatechuic acid. Potassium bromate (12.5 mg/kg) and protocatechuic acid (120 mg/kg) were administered orally while omeprazole (20 mg/kg) was used as standard. Potassium bromate exacerbated gastric ulcers, increased malonaldehyde levels, catalase, and sodium pump activities, but reduced nitric oxide levels. Potassium bromate further increased mast cell count in the muscularis mucosa, while inducing chronic inflammation and moderate angiogenesis in the gastric mucosa. Our results delineate KBrO3-induced gastric epithelial cytotoxicity that is ameliorated by protocatechuic acid. Practical applications: Potassium bromate is a known food additive in the baking, brewing, and cheese-making process. Conversely, protocatechuic acid (3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid) is the polyphenolic content of plants like Hibiscus sabdariffa L that are commonly consumed as herbal drink, food, spices, and used in folk medicine. This study reports the cytoprotective effect of protocatechuic acid against gastric mucosa ulceration that has been aggravated by potassium bromate."
Supramolecular peptide therapeutics: Host–guest interaction-assisted systemic delivery of anticancer peptides,"The poor stability of therapeutic peptides in physiological environments hampers their therapeutic efficacy. In this work, a strategy of supramolecular peptide therapeutics (SPT) was proposed for the improvement of the stability and anticancer efficacy of the peptides in vivo. N-Terminal phenylalanine-containing cytotoxic peptides were carried in the cucurbit[7]uril-containing polymer through host–guest interactions between the phenylalanine and cucurbit[7]uril, generating the supramolecular peptide complex with high peptide encapsulation efficiency (> 97%). The formation of the supramolecular peptide complex reserved the biological activities of the peptide, presenting prolonged blood circulation and improved anticancer efficacy. This SPT strategy might provide a cucurbituril- and phenylalanine-functionalized approach for the design and the development of peptide-based pharmaceuticals."
Use of ratiometrically designed nanocarrier targeting CDK4/6 and autophagy pathways for effective pancreatic cancer treatment,"Aberrant cell cycle machinery and loss of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor locus make CDK4/6 a potential target in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, a vast majority of PDAC cases do not harbor a durable response to monotherapy of CDK4/6 inhibitor. Utilizing remote loading to co-encapsulate CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (PAL) and an autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), we demonstrate a ratiometrically designed mesoporous silica nanoformulation with synergistic efficacy in subcutaneous and orthotopic PDAC mouse models. The synergism is attributed to the effective intratumoral buildup of PAL/HCQ, which otherwise exhibit distinctly different circulatory and biodistribution profile. PAL/HCQ co-delivery nanoparticles lead to the most effective shrinkage of PDAC compared to various controls, including free drug mixture. Immunohistochemistry reveals that PAL/HCQ co-delivery nanoparticles trigger anti-apoptotic pathway after repetitive intravenous administrations in mice. When combined with a Bcl inhibitor, the performance of co-delivery nanoparticles is further improved, leading to a long-lasting anti-PDAC effect in vivo."
Protein-bound calcium phosphate in uremic rat serum: a quantitative study,"Abstract: Protein-bound calcium (prCa) constitutes about 40% of serum total calcium, in which albumin is the most dominant protein. Given the chemical interaction between calcium and phosphate (Pi), the increased serum Pi in chronic kidney disease may cause changes in the composition and structure of the prCa fraction. Here, we report the phosphate binding on the protein-bound calcium in uremic rat serum. Using adenine-fed rats as a uremic model, we separated the calcium and phosphate fractions in rat serum by ultrafiltration, and found that the level of protein-bound phosphate (prPi) in the uremic serum was markedly higher than in control. The elevated prPi level was comparable to the prCa level, consistent with the presence of protein-bound calcium phosphate pr(Ca)j−m(CaPi)m. We then confirmed its presence by ex vivo X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, revealing the discrete state of the calcium phosphate clusters associated with protein. Finally, in a quantitative investigation using Ca- and Pi-boosted serum, we discovered the threshold concentration for the Pi binding on prCa, and determined the binding constant. The threshold, while preventing Pi from binding to prCa in normal condition, allows the reaction to take place in hyperphosphatemia conditions. The protein-bound calcium phosphate could act as a link between the metabolism of serum proteins and the homeostasis of phosphate and calcium, and it deserves further investigation whether the molar ratio of (prPi/prCa)⋅100% may serve as a serum index of the vascular calcification status in chronic kidney disease.

Interfacial rheology for the assessment of potential health effects of inhaled carbon nanomaterials at variable breathing conditions,"Lung surface is the first line of contact between inhaled carbon nanomaterials, CNMs, and the organism, so this is the place where pulmonary health effects begin. The paper analyzes the influence of several CNMs (single- and multi-walled nanotubes with various surface area: 90–1,280 m2/g and aspect ratio: 8–3,750) on the surface-active properties of the lung surfactant, LS, model (Survanta). Effects of CNM concentration (0.1–1 mg/ml) and surface oscillation rate were determined using the oscillating drop method at simulated breathing conditions (2–10 s per cycle, 37 °C). Based on the values of apparent elasticity and viscosity of the interfacial region, new parameters: Sε and Sμ were proposed to evaluate potential effect of particles on the LS at various breathing rates. Some of tested CNMs (e.g., COOH- functionalized short nanotubes) significantly influenced the surfactant dynamics, while the other had weaker effects even at high particle concentration. Analysis of changes in Sε and Sμ provides a new way to evaluate of a possible disturbance of the basic functions of LS. The results show that the expected pulmonary effects caused by inhaled CNMs at variable breathing rate depend not only on particle concentration (inhaled dose) but also on their size, structure and surface properties."
Predicting nanotoxicity by an integrated machine learning and metabolomics approach,Integrating machine learning and metabolomics establishes the complicated relationships between the properties of nanopartices and metabolic pathways.
A framework for grouping and read-across of nanomaterials- supporting innovation and risk assessment,"According to some legislation grouping can streamline data gap filling for the hazard assessment of substances. The GRACIOUS Framework aims to facilitate the application of grouping of nanomaterials or nanoforms (NFs), in a regulatory context and to support innovation. This includes using grouping to enable read-across from (a) source(s), for which data and information exist, to a similar target NF where information is lacking. The Framework provides an initial set of hypotheses for the grouping of NFs which take into account the identity and use(s) of the NFs, as well as the purpose of grouping. Initial collection of basic information allows selection of an appropriate pre-defined grouping hypothesis and a tailored Integrated Approach to Testing and Assessment (IATA), designed to generate new evidence to support acceptance or rejection of the hypothesis. Users needing to develop their own user-defined hypothesis (and IATA) are also supported by the Framework. In addition, the IATA guides acquisition of the information needed to support read-across. This approach gathers information to render risk assessment more efficient, affordable, as well as reducing the use of test animals."
"Amyloidosis inhibition, a new frontier of the protein corona","The protein corona has served as a central dogma and a nuisance to the applications of nanomedicine and nanobiotechnology for well over a decade. Here we introduce the emerging field of amyloidosis inhibition, which aims to understand and harness the interfacial phenomena associated with a nanoparticle interacting with pathogenic amyloid proteins. Much of this interaction correlates with our understanding of the protein corona, and yet much differs, as elaborated for the first time in this Perspective. Specifically, we examine the in vitro, in silico and in vivo features of the new class of “amyloid protein corona”, and discuss how the interactions with nanoparticles may halt the self-assembly of amyloid proteins. As amyloidosis is driven off pathway by the nanoparticles, the oligomeric and protofibrillar populations are suppressed to ameliorate their cytotoxicity. Furthermore, as amyloid proteins spread via the transport of bodily fluids or cross seeding, amyloidosis is inherently associated with dynamic proteins and ligands to evoke the immune system. Accordingly, we ponder the structural and medical implications of the amyloid protein corona in the presence of their stimulated cytokines. Understanding and exploiting the amyloid protein corona may facilitate the development of new theranostics against a range of debilitating amyloid diseases."
Safety and effectiveness evaluation of flexible electronic materials for next generation wearable and implantable medical devices,"With the increased aging population and economic climate, people's demand for healthcare has changed from seeking medical treatment after illness to maintaining active health into later years. Flexible electronic technological advancements have now given us the potential to develop wearable, next-generation implantable medical devices. However, before flexible electronic technology is expected to be commonplace for medical devices, safety and effectiveness in their intended clinical uses must first be proven. This paper summarizes the latest developments in flexible electronic technology in the context of medicine and healthcare, with emphasis on the requirements for safety and effectiveness evaluation of such innovations for medical devices from the perspective of regulatory science. Herein, we attempt to establish a standardized evaluation system suitable for the characteristics of flexible electronic technology, with the goal to help expedite the development of innovative medical devices based on flexible electronic technology from the laboratory to clinically approved products."
Proteasome activity regulated by charged gold nanoclusters: Implications for neurodegenerative diseases,"The 20S proteasome, the catalytic core particle of 26S proteasome, degrades a wide range of intracellular proteins, which is essential for many cellular processes. Herein, we have found that the 20S proteasome activity is either up- or down-regulated by introducing gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) coated with nine peptide tails in two different forms, AuNC(−) and AuNC(+), each encoding five consecutive negatively or positively charged amino acids. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that AuNC(−) and AuNC(+) bind to different surfaces of the 20S proteasome, and respectively facilitate or hinder the opening of the central gate of 20S proteasome for substrate access to the internal active site for protein degradation. Furthermore, the addition of AuNC(-) induces protective effects in a cell model of Parkinson's disease, by up-regulating the proteasome activity under the condition of reduced ATP production, and enhancing the degradation of overexpressed α-synuclein, thereby attenuating the loss of cell viability. Our findings suggest the potential application of gold nanoclusters for treating neurodegenerative diseases."
Vacancies on 2D transition metal dichalcogenides elicit ferroptotic cell death,"Sustainable developments of nanotechnology necessitate the exploration of structure-activity relationships (SARs) at nano-bio interfaces. While ferroptosis may contribute in the developments of some severe diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, stroke and tumors), the cellular pathways and nano-SARs are rarely explored in diseases elicited by nano-sized ferroptosis inducers. Here we find that WS2 and MoS2 nanosheets induce an iron-dependent cell death, ferroptosis in epithelial (BEAS-2B) and macrophage (THP-1) cells, evidenced by the suppression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), oxygen radical generation and lipid peroxidation. Notably, nano-SAR analysis of 20 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) disclosures the decisive role of surface vacancy in ferroptosis. We therefore develop methanol and sulfide passivation as safe design approaches for TMD nanosheets. These findings are validated in animal lungs by oropharyngeal aspiration of TMD nanosheets. Overall, our study highlights the key cellular events as well as nano-SARs in TMD-induced ferroptosis, which may facilitate the safe design of nanoproducts."
Efficient hepatic delivery and protein expression enabled by optimized mRNA and ionizable lipid nanoparticle,"mRNA is a novel class of therapeutic modality that holds great promise in vaccination, protein replacement therapy, cancer immunotherapy, immune cell engineering etc. However, optimization of mRNA molecules and efficient in vivo delivery are quite important but challenging for its broad application. Here we present an ionizable lipid nanoparticle (iLNP) based on iBL0713 lipid for in vitro and in vivo expression of desired proteins using codon-optimized mRNAs. mRNAs encoding luciferase or erythropoietin (EPO) were prepared by in vitro transcription and formulated with proposed iLNP, to form iLP171/mRNA formulations. It was revealed that both luciferase and EPO proteins were successfully expressed by human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and hepatocytes. The maximum amount of protein expression was found at 6 h post-administration. The expression efficiency of EPO with codon-optimized mRNA was significantly higher than that of unoptimized mRNA. Moreover, no toxicity or immunogenicity was observed for these mRNA formulations. Therefore, our study provides a useful and promising platform for mRNA therapeutic development."
Dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticle-induced nanotoxicity in neuron cultures,"Recent technological advances have introduced diverse engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) into our air, water, medicine, cosmetics, clothing, and food. However, the health and environmental effects of these increasingly common ENPs are still not well understood. In particular, potential neurological effects are one of the most poorly understood areas of nanoparticle toxicology (nanotoxicology), in that low-to-moderate neurotoxicity can be subtle and difficult to measure. Culturing primary neuron explants on planar microelectrode arrays (MEAs) has emerged as one of the most promising in vitro techniques with which to study neuro-nanotoxicology, as MEAs enable the fluorescent tracking of nanoparticles together with neuronal electrical activity recording at the submillisecond time scale, enabling the resolution of individual action potentials. Here we examine the dose-dependent neurotoxicity of dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (dIONPs), a common type of functionalized ENP used in biomedical applications, on cultured primary neurons harvested from postnatal day 0–1 mouse brains. A range of dIONP concentrations (5–40 µg/ml) were added to neuron cultures, and cells were plated either onto well plates for live cell, fluorescent reactive oxidative species (ROS) and viability observations, or onto planar microelectrode arrays (MEAs) for electrophysiological measurements. Below 10 µg/ml, there were no dose-dependent cellular ROS increases or effects in MEA bursting behavior at sub-lethal dosages. However, above 20 µg/ml, cell death was obvious and widespread. Our findings demonstrate a significant dIONP toxicity in cultured neurons at concentrations previously reported to be safe for stem cells and other non-neuronal cell types."
Indium oxide nanoparticles induce lung intercellular toxicity between bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages,"Concerns have been raised over the safety and health of industrial workers exposed to indium oxide nanoparticles (IO-NPs) when working. IO-NPs were previously shown in vitro and in vivo to be cytotoxic, but the mechanism of pathogenesis was unclear. In this study, the effects of IO-NPs on lung cells associated with respiratory and immune barriers and the toxic effects of intercellular cascades were studied. Here IO-NPs had acute toxicity to Wistar rats over a time course (5 days post-intratracheal instillation). Following treatment epithelial cells (16HBE) or macrophages (RAW264.7) with IO-NPs or IO fine particles (IO-FPs), the damage of 16HBE cells caused by IO-NPs was serious, mainly in the mitochondrial and rough endoplasmic reticulum. The lactate dehydrogenase level also showed that cytotoxicity in vitro was more serious for IO-NPs compared with IO-FPs. The level of In3+ (examined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) in 16HBE cells was 10 times higher than that in RAW cells. In3+, releasing from IO-NPs absorbed by 16HBE cells, could not only significantly inhibit the phagocytosis and migration of macrophages (P <.0001), but also stimulate RAW cells to secrete high levels of inflammatory cytokines. IO-NPs can directly damage pulmonary epithelial cells. The In3+ released by epithelial cells affect the phagocytosis and migration of macrophages, which may be a new point for the decrease in the clearance of alveolar surfactants and the development of IO-related pulmonary alveolar proteinosis."
Uptake of graphene enhanced the photophosphorylation performed by chloroplasts in rice plants,"New and enhanced functions were potentially imparted to the plant organelles after interaction with nanoparticles. In this study, we found that ∼ 44% and ∼ 29% of the accumulated graphene in the rice leaves passively transported to the chloroplasts and thylakoid, respectively, significantly enhanced the fluorescence intensity of chloroplasts, and promoted about 2.4 times higher adenosine triphosphate production than that of controls. The enhancement of graphene on the photophosphorylation was ascribed to two reasons: One is that graphene facilitates the electron transfer process of photosystem II in thylakoid, and the other is that graphene protects the photosystem II against photo-bleaching by acting as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species. Overall, our work here confirmed that graphene translocating in the thylakoid promoted the photosynthetic activity of chloroplast in vivo and in vitro, providing new opportunities for designing biomimetic materials to enhance the solar energy conversion systems, especially for repairing or increasing the photosynthesis activity of the plants grown under stress environment.

Therapeutic siRNA: state of the art,"RNA interference (RNAi) is an ancient biological mechanism used to defend against external invasion. It theoretically can silence any disease-related genes in a sequence-specific manner, making small interfering RNA (siRNA) a promising therapeutic modality. After a two-decade journey from its discovery, two approvals of siRNA therapeutics, ONPATTRO® (patisiran) and GIVLAARI™ (givosiran), have been achieved by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. Reviewing the long-term pharmaceutical history of human beings, siRNA therapy currently has set up an extraordinary milestone, as it has already changed and will continue to change the treatment and management of human diseases. It can be administered quarterly, even twice-yearly, to achieve therapeutic effects, which is not the case for small molecules and antibodies. The drug development process was extremely hard, aiming to surmount complex obstacles, such as how to efficiently and safely deliver siRNAs to desired tissues and cells and how to enhance the performance of siRNAs with respect to their activity, stability, specificity and potential off-target effects. In this review, the evolution of siRNA chemical modifications and their biomedical performance are comprehensively reviewed. All clinically explored and commercialized siRNA delivery platforms, including the GalNAc (N-acetylgalactosamine)–siRNA conjugate, and their fundamental design principles are thoroughly discussed. The latest progress in siRNA therapeutic development is also summarized. This review provides a comprehensive view and roadmap for general readers working in the field."
Construction of a web-based nanomaterial database by big data curation and modeling friendly nanostructure annotations,"Modern nanotechnology research has generated numerous experimental data for various nanomaterials. However, the few nanomaterial databases available are not suitable for modeling studies due to the way they are curated. Here, we report the construction of a large nanomaterial database containing annotated nanostructures suited for modeling research. The database, which is publicly available through http://www.pubvinas.com/, contains 705 unique nanomaterials covering 11 material types. Each nanomaterial has up to six physicochemical properties and/or bioactivities, resulting in more than ten endpoints in the database. All the nanostructures are annotated and transformed into protein data bank files, which are downloadable by researchers worldwide. Furthermore, the nanostructure annotation procedure generates 2142 nanodescriptors for all nanomaterials for machine learning purposes, which are also available through the portal. This database provides a public resource for data-driven nanoinformatics modeling research aimed at rational nanomaterial design and other areas of modern computational nanotechnology."
Surmounting the endothelial barrier for delivery of drugs and imaging tracers,"The endothelium is crucial for maintaining vascular homeostasis and functions as a barrier between blood components and tissue. In atherosclerosis, this barrier function is impaired, which is characterized by secretion of chemoattractants and cytokines, upregulation of adhesion molecules and increased vascular permeability. This facilitates enhanced leukocyte migration through the vessel wall. Fortunately, we can utilize these features to our advantage by using nanomedicine to deliver drugs and imaging tracers into the interstitial space. This provides us with targeted, local delivery of therapeutic agents, which enhances the specificity and efficacy of these agents and thus, could be used to inhibit disease progression. Additionally, delivery of imaging tracers in the interstitial space will give us insight into the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques by targeting resident macrophages and activated endothelial cells, providing pivotal information that is currently lacking in the clinic. In this review, we discuss how the endothelial barrier is affected during atherosclerosis and how to surmount this barrier for successful delivery of nanomedicine carrying drugs and imaging tracers to both the endothelium and macrophages."
DNA:RNA hybrid G-quadruplex formation upstream of transcription start site,"Bioinformatic analysis reveals an enrichment of putative DNA:RNA hybrid G-quadruplex-forming sequences (PHQS) on both sides of the transcription start sites (TSSs) in the genome of warm-blooded animals, suggesting a positive selection of PHQSs in evolution and functional role of DNA:RNA hybrid G-quadruplexes (HQs) in transcription. The formation of HQs downstream of TSS in transcribed DNA has been documented under in vitro conditions; however, it is still not known if such HQs can form at the upstream side of TSSs. In this study, we report that such HQs can form in transcription in DNA with two to three guanine tracts if RNA carrying the required number of G-tracts is supplied. We also show that the formation of such HQs is dependent on the negative supercoiling generated by RNA polymerases. These results suggest that HQs may also form at the upstream side of TSSs in vivo and play a role in transcription since the two requirements are satisfied in cells."
In situ construction of ligand nano-network to integrin α<inf>v</inf>β<inf>3</inf> for angiogenesis inhibition,"Angiogenesis occurs during the process of tumor growth, invasion and metastasis, and is essential for the survival of solid tumors. As an integrin significantly overexpressed in human tumor vascular endothelial cells, αvβ3 is a suitable targeting site for anti-angiogenesis of tumor. We designed and prepared a self-assembling peptide (SAP) with the ability to targeting αvβ3 and self-assembly. SAP formed nanoparticles in solution and transformed into nanofibrous network once specifically binding to integrin αvβ3 on the surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The SAP network stably anchored on HUVECs over 24 h, which consequently resulted in high-efficient inhibition of vascularization. In vitro anti-angiogenesis experiment displayed that the inhibition rate of tube-formation reached 94.9%. In vivo anti-angiogenesis array based on chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model exhibited that the SAP had an inhibition rate up to 63.1%. These results indicated the outstanding anti-angiogenic ability of SAP, potentially for tumor therapy."
A self-assembling peptide targeting VEGF receptors to inhibit angiogenesis,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) pathways are essential in tumor angiogenesis, growth and metastasis. Studies on anti-angiogenic therapy have been mostly focused on the blockage of VEGF-VEGFR pathways. We report an extracellularly transformable peptide-based nanomaterial to develop artificial extracellular matrix (ECM)-like networks for high-efficient blockage of natural VEGF-VEGFR interactions. The transformable peptide-based nanomaterial transforms from nanoparticles into nanofibers upon binding to VEGFR in solution. In addition, the transformable peptide-based nanomaterial forms ECM-like fibrous networks on VEGFR overexpressed cells, inhibiting the VEGF-VEGFR interactions and the subsequent angiogenesis. The tube formation is reduced by nearly 85.1% after treatment. This strategy shows excellent potential for anti-angiogenesis, and inhibition of tumor invasion and metastasis."
Gadolinium labelled nanoliposomes as the platform for MRI theranostics: in vitro safety study in liver cells and macrophages,"Gadolinium (Gd)–based contrast agents are extensively used for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Liposomes are potential nanocarrier–based biocompatible platforms for development of new generations of MRI diagnostics. Liposomes with Gd–complexes (Gd–lip) co–encapsulated with thrombolytic agents can serve both for imaging and treatment of various pathological states including stroke. In this study, we evaluated nanosafety of Gd–lip containing PE-DTPA chelating Gd+3 prepared by lipid film hydration method. We detected no cytotoxicity of Gd–lip in human liver cells including cancer HepG2, progenitor (non–differentiated) HepaRG, and differentiated HepaRG cells. Furthermore, no potential side effects of Gd–lip were found using a complex system including general biomarkers of toxicity, such as induction of early response genes, oxidative, heat shock and endoplasmic reticulum stress, DNA damage responses, induction of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, and changes in sphingolipid metabolism in differentiated HepaRG. Moreover, Gd–lip did not show pro–inflammatory effects, as assessed in an assay based on activation of inflammasome NLRP3 in a model of human macrophages, and release of eicosanoids from HepaRG cells. In conclusion, this in vitro study indicates potential in vivo safety of Gd–lip with respect to hepatotoxicity and immunopathology caused by inflammation."
Enhancing multiphoton upconversion through interfacial energy transfer in multilayered nanoparticles,"Photon upconversion in lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles offers a wide variety of applications including deep-tissue biophotonics. However, the upconversion luminescence and efficiency, especially involving multiple photons, is still limited by the concentration quenching effect. Here, we demonstrate a multilayered core-shell-shell structure for lanthanide doped NaYF4, where Er3+ activators and Yb3+ sensitizers are spatially separated, which can enhance the multiphoton emission from Er3+ by 100-fold compared with the multiphoton emission from canonical core-shell nanocrystals. This difference is due to the excitation energy transfer at the interface between activator core and sensitizer shell being unexpectedly efficient, as revealed by the structural and temperature dependence of the multiphoton upconversion luminescence. Therefore, the concentration quenching is suppressed via alleviation of cross-relaxation between the activator and the sensitizer, resulting in a high quantum yield of up to 6.34% for this layered structure. These findings will enable versatile design of multiphoton upconverting nanoparticles overcoming the conventional limitation."
Blood-triggered generation of platinum nanoparticle functions as an anti-cancer agent,"Since the discovery of metal nanoparticles (NPs) in the 1960s, unknown toxicity, cost and the ethical hurdles of research in humans have hindered the translation of these NPs to clinical use. In this work, we demonstrate that Pt NPs with protein coronas are generated in vivo in human blood when a patient is treated with cisplatin. These self-assembled Pt NPs form rapidly, accumulate in tumors, and remain in the body for an extended period of time. Additionally, the Pt NPs are safe for use in humans and can act as anti-cancer agents to inhibit chemotherapy-resistant tumor growth by consuming intracellular glutathione and activating apoptosis. The tumor inhibitory activity is greatly amplified when the Pt NPs are loaded in vitro with the chemotherapeutic drug, daunorubicin, and the formulation is effective even in daunorubicin-resistant models. These in vivo-generated metal NPs represent a biocompatible drug delivery platform for chemotherapy resistant tumor treatment."
Predicting dissolution and transformation of inhaled nanoparticles in the lung using abiotic flow cells: The case of barium sulfate,"Barium sulfate (BaSO4) was considered to be poorly-soluble and of low toxicity, but BaSO4 NM-220 showed a surprisingly short retention after intratracheal instillation in rat lungs, and incorporation of Ba within the bones. Here we show that static abiotic dissolution cannot rationalize this result, whereas two dynamic abiotic dissolution systems (one flow-through and one flow-by) indicated 50% dissolution after 5 to 6 days at non-saturating conditions regardless of flow orientation, which is close to the in vivo half-time of 9.6 days. Non-equilibrium conditions were thus essential to simulate in vivo biodissolution. Instead of shrinking from 32 nm to 23 nm (to match the mass loss to ions), TEM scans of particles retrieved from flow-cells showed an increase to 40 nm. Such transformation suggested either material transport through interfacial contact or Ostwald ripening at super-saturating conditions and was also observed in vivo inside macrophages by high-resolution TEM following 12 months inhalation exposure. The abiotic flow cells thus adequately predicted the overall pulmonary biopersistence of the particles that was mediated by non-equilibrium dissolution and recrystallization. The present methodology for dissolution and transformation fills a high priority gap in nanomaterial hazard assessment and is proposed for the implementation of grouping and read-across by dissolution rates."
Two-Dimensional Nanomaterials With Enzyme-Like Properties for Biomedical Applications,"Recently, remarkable progress has been made in nanozyme research due to the rapid development of nanomaterials. Two-dimensional nanomaterials such as metal nanosheets, graphene-based materials, transition metal oxides/dichalcogenides, etc., provide enhanced physical and chemical functionality owing to their ultrathin structures, high surface-to-volume ratios, and surface charges. They have also been found to have high catalytic activities in terms of natural enzymes such as peroxidase, oxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. This review provides an overview of the recent progress of nanozymes based on two-dimensional nanomaterials, with an emphasis on their synthetic strategies, hybridization, catalytic properties, and biomedical applications. Finally, the future challenges and prospects for this research are discussed."
Tumor-Microenvironment- Responsive Size-Shrinkable Drug-Delivery Nanosystems for Deepened Penetration Into Tumors,"Over the years, the manipulation and clinical application of drug-delivery nanosystems for cancer diseases have attracted a rapid growth of academic research interests, and some nanodrugs have been approved for clinic application. Although encouraging achievements have been made, the potency of nanomedicines in cancer treatment is far from satisfaction, and one significant reason is the inefficient penetration of nanoparticles into solid tumors. Particle size is one of the most significant features that influence diffusion ability of the drug-delivery system in tumors. Size-shrinkable drug-delivery nanosystems possess a size-switchable property that can achieve passive targeting via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and transform into ultrasmall particles in tumors for deep penetration into tumors. The tumor microenvironment is characterized by acidic pH, hypoxia, upregulated levels of enzymes, and a redox environment. In this review, we summarize and analyze the current research progresses and challenges in tumor microenvironment responsive size-shrinkable drug-delivery nanosystems. We further expect to present some meaningful proposals and enlightenments on promoting deep penetration into tumors of nanoparticles."
Brave new world revisited: Focus on nanomedicine,"Nanomedicine is at a crossroads: with relatively few success stories in terms of clinical translation despite more and more research on increasingly sophisticated nanomaterials, it is important to consider whether we are on the right track. Indeed, it is crucial that we address the fact that while considerable efforts are being made to overcome barriers to translation from the bench to the clinic, scientists are still struggling to decipher fundamental aspects of nanomaterial interactions with biological systems. We believe that a key to the successful adoption of nanomedicines in oncology and beyond lies in a deeper understanding of underlying biological processes and in decoding interactions between engineered nanomaterials and biological systems. Here we provide an overview of progress in nanomedicine during the past 5 years."
MnO<inf>2</inf>/Porous Carbon Nanotube/MnO<inf>2</inf>Nanocomposites for High-Performance Supercapacitor,"In this paper, a superior supercapacitor nanocomposite based on porous carbon nanotubes (PCNTs), MnO2/PCNT/MnO2, was synthesized, which displayed superior specific capacitance (C = 341.5 F g-1, 2 mV s-1), excellent rate capability (C = 214.3 F g-1, 63% capacity retention, 100 mV s-1), and high cyclic stability (98% efficiency after 6000 charge/discharge cycles). The outstanding improvement of its electrochemical performances resulted from the massive nanopores on the walls of PCNTs, which made more MnO2 nanoparticles filled both in the nanocavity and on the surface of PCNTs as electroactive sites. At the same time, PCNTs improve the electrical conductivity with the pore structure being beneficial to ion exchange, they shorten the ion transport distance, and adjust to the volume expansion and contraction among charge/discharge. In addition, the Mn(IV)/Mn(III) redox electric pair in the nanocavity enhances the capacity storage. Therefore, the MnO2/PCNT/MnO2 nanocomposite shows higher specific capacitance and excellent cyclic stability."
Few-layer bismuthene for checkpoint knockdown enhanced cancer immunotherapy with rapid clearance and sequentially triggered one-for-all strategy,"As a conceptually attractive strategy, the use of immune checkpoint blockade antibodies to treat cancer is limited due to the restrained tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), poor accumulation and penetration of antibodies, and deficient checkpoint blockade in malignancies. In this study, we describe a pH and mild photothermal sequentially triggered PD-L1 siRNA release nanosystem, based on monoelemental bismuthene, as a one-for-all strategy to realize enhanced tumor mild photothermal immunotherapy. Under manually controlled NIR irradiation, the bismuthene-based nanosystem simultaneously induces a tumor-enhanced pathological permeability and retention (EPPR) effect, increases TIL recruitment, and triggers programmed siRNA release, thereby amplifying anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. In addition, the nanosystem’s rapid removal through intestinal and renal clearance mitigates toxicity risk associated with long-term retention. In vivo antitumor experiments demonstrate that this bismuthene-based nanosystem is a promising and effective approach for “cold” tumor management."
Implications of the human gut-brain and gut-cancer axes for future nanomedicine,"Recent clinical and pathological evidence have implicated the gut microbiota as a nexus for modulating the homeostasis of the human body, impacting conditions from cancer and dementia to obesity and social behavior. The connections between microbiota and human diseases offer numerous opportunities in medicine, most of which have limited or no therapeutic solutions available. In light of this paradigm-setting trend in science, this review aims to provide a comprehensive and timely summary of the mechanistic pathways governing the gut microbiota and their implications for nanomedicines targeting cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, we discuss in parallel the beneficial and pathogenic relationship of the gut microbiota along the gut-brain and gut-cancer axes, elaborate on the impact of dysbiosis and the gastrointestinal corona on the efficacy of nanomedicines, and highlight a molecular mimicry that manipulates the universal cross-β backbone of bacterial amyloid to accelerate neurological disorders. This review further offers a forward-looking section on the rational design of cancer and dementia nanomedicines exploiting the gut-brain and gut-cancer axes."
Near-infrared light irradiation induced mild hyperthermia enhances glutathione depletion and DNA interstrand cross-link formation for efficient chemotherapy,"DNA alkylating agents generally kill tumor cells by covalently binding with DNA to form interstrand or intrastrand cross-links. However, in the case of cisplatin, only a few DNA adducts (<1%) are highly toxic irreparable interstrand cross-links. Furthermore, cisplatin is rapidly detoxified by high levels of intracellular thiols such as glutathione (GSH). Since the discovery of its mechanism of action, people have been looking for ways to directly and efficiently remove intracellular GSH and increase interstrand cross-links to improve drug efficacy and overcome resistance, but there has been little breakthrough. Herein, we hypothesized that the anticancer efficiency of cisplatin can be enhanced through iodo-thiol click chemistry mediated GSH depletion and increased formation of DNA interstrand cross-links via mild hyperthermia triggered by near-infrared (NIR) light. This was achieved by preparing an amphiphilic polymer with platinum(IV) (Pt(IV)) prodrugs and pendant iodine atoms (iodides). The polymer was further used to encapsulate IR780 and assembled into Pt-I-IR780 nanoparticles. Induction of mild hyperthermia (43 °C) at the tumor site by NIR light irradiation had three effects: (1) it accelerated the GSH-mediated reduction of Pt(IV) in the polymer main chain to platinum(II) (Pt(II)); (2) it boosted the iodo-thiol substitution click reaction between GSH and iodide, thereby attenuating the GSH-mediated detoxification of cisplatin; (3) it increased the proportion of highly toxic and irreparable Pt-DNA interstrand cross-links. Therefore, we find that mild hyperthermia induced via NIR irradiation can enhance the killing of cancer cells and reduce the tumor burden, thus delivering efficient chemotherapy."
Recent progress of therapeutic peptide based nanomaterials: From synthesis and self-assembly to cancer treatment,"Peptides have shown great potential in cancer treatment due to their good biocompatibility and low toxicity. However, the bioavailability and adverse immune response of peptides limit their further translation from bench to bedside. Over the past few decades, various peptide-based nanomaterials have been developed for drug delivery and cancer treatment. Compared with therapeutic peptides alone, self-assembled peptide nanomaterials have obvious advantages, such as improved stability and biodistribution for high-performance cancer therapy. In this review, we have described the synthesis, self-assembly and the anti-cancer application of therapeutic peptides and their conjugates, particularly polymer-peptide conjugates (PPCs)."
Comprehensive analysis of preparation strategies for phase change nanocomposites and nanofluids with brief overview of safety equipment,"The preparation process of the nanocomposites and nanofluids strongly affects their general physical properties and stability in general. They are very sensitive with respect to the quality of the preparation process which should be obtained carefully to produce quality and reliable homogeneous samples. This paper provides a useful analysis in different preparation procedures with the focus on the nano-enhanced phase change materials (NEPCM) and fluids (nanofluids) due to their wide application areas. The preparation processes were identified and categorized together with the key parameters that have an important impact on the preparation process in general. The main problems and issues during the preparation process were discussed and elaborated in detail, gained by a detailed analysis of commonly applied preparation procedures. Since the preparation process of both nanofluids and nanocomposites should be carefully planned regarding the working safety, an overview of the safety equipment was provided as well as an assessment of the toxic potential of nanomaterials. Quality and well obtained preparation process can contribute to the rational utilization of the nanomaterials, and by that, it could reduce negative environmental footprints released from production as well as application of the nanomaterials. The main research findings of this paper provide useful guidelines for researchers dealing with the preparation of nano-enhanced fluids and phase change materials that should be helpful to get insights directed to the complexity of the preparation process and ensure an efficient preparation process."
Identifying Differing Intracellular Cargo Release Mechanisms by Monitoring In Vitro Drug Delivery from MOFs in Real Time,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proposed as biocompatible candidates for the targeted intracellular delivery of chemotherapeutic payloads, but the site of drug loading and subsequent effect on intracellular release is often overlooked. Here, we analyze doxorubicin delivery to cancer cells by MIL-101(Cr) and UiO-66 in real time. Having experimentally and computationally verified that doxorubicin is pore loaded in MIL-101(Cr) and surface loaded on UiO-66, different time-dependent cytotoxicity profiles are observed by real-time cell analysis and confocal microscopy. The attenuated release of aggregated doxorubicin from the surface of Dox@UiO-66 results in a 12 to 16 h induction of cytotoxicity, while rapid release of pore-dispersed doxorubicin from Dox@MIL-101(Cr) leads to significantly higher intranuclear localization and rapid cell death. In verifying real-time cell analysis as a versatile tool to assess biocompatibility and drug delivery, we show that the localization of drugs in (or on) MOF nanoparticles controls delivery profiles and is key to understanding in vitro modes of action."
Mercaptophenylboronic Acid-Activated Gold Nanoparticles as Nanoantibiotics against Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria,"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria-induced infections are becoming challenging issues threatening human health and life. Current antibiotics can hardly tackle this problem. Herein, we present a strategy to prepare mercaptophenylboronic acid (MBA)-activated gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) as an antibacterial agent against MDR bacteria. Both Au NPs and MBA cannot serve as antibiotics. However, when MBA attaches on Au NPs, the Au-MBA NPs show potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive MDR clinical isolates (e.g., MDR Staphyloccocus aureus, MDR S. aureus; MDR Staphyloccocus epidermidis, MDR S. epidermidis). Furthermore, Au-MBA NPs show an extremely high median lethal dose (LD50,i.v., 960 mg/kg), which is much higher than those of most of the clinically used antibiotics. As an application example, we dope Au-MBA NPs with electrospun poly(ϵ-caprolactone) (PCL)/gelatin nanofibrous membranes as wound dressings, which show striking ability to remedy S. aureus- or MDR S. aureus-infected full-thickness skin wounds on rats. Our study provides a novel strategy for treating MDR bacteria-infected wounds in a simple, low-cost, and efficient way, which holds promise for broad clinical applications."
Detection of genomic G-quadruplexes in living cells using a small artificial protein,"G-quadruplex (G4) structures formed by guanine-rich nucleic acids are implicated in essential physiological and pathological processes and serve as important drug targets. The genome-wide detection of G4s in living cells is important for exploring the functional role of G4s but has not yet been achieved due to the lack of a suitable G4 probe. Here we report an artificial 6.7 kDa G4 probe (G4P) protein that binds G4s with high affinity and specificity. We used it to capture G4s in living human, mouse, and chicken cells with the ChIP-Seq technique, yielding genome-wide landscape as well as details on the positions, frequencies, and sequence identities of G4 formation in these cells. Our results indicate that transcription is accompanied by a robust formation of G4s in genes. In human cells, we detected up to >123 000 G4P peaks, of which >1/3 had a fold increase of ≥5 and were present in >60% promoters and 70% genes. Being much smaller than a scFv antibody (27 kDa) or even a nanobody (12-15 kDa), we expect that the G4P may find diverse applications in biology, medicine, and molecular devices as a G4 affinity agent."
"Unravelling the Immunotoxicity of Polycaprolactone Nanoparticles-Effects of Polymer Molecular Weight, Hydrolysis, and Blends","Poly-ϵ-caprolactone (PCL) is a biodegradable polyester that has FDA and CE approval as a medical device. Nonetheless, the lack of toxicity exhibited by the polymer cannot be extrapolated to its nanomaterial conformation. Despite PCL-based NPs being widely studied in the biomedical field for their advantages as controlled drug delivery systems, little data describe PCL NPs' toxicity, particularly immunotoxicity. This work assessed different PCL-based delivery systems intended for protein delivery regarding their immunotoxicity and hemocompatibility. Two different molecular weight PCL polymers were used, as well as blends with chitosan and glucan. Results showed that the presence of NaOH during the production of PCL2 NPs and PCL2/glucan NPs induced PCL alkali hydrolysis, generating more reactive groups (carboxyl and hydroxyl) that contributed to an increased toxicity of the NPs (higher reduction in peripheral blood mononuclear cell viability and lower hemocompatibility). PCL2/glucan NPs showed an anti-inflammatory activity characterized by the inhibition of LPS stimulated nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-α. In conclusion, generalizations among different PCL NP delivery systems must be avoided, and immunotoxicity assessments should be performed in the early stage of product development to increase the clinical success of the nanomedicine."
First-principles studies in Mg-based hydrogen storage Materials: A review,"Hydrogen storage efficiency is essential for a booming clean hydrogen energy economy. Mg-based hydrogen storage materials have been intensively investigated due to their advantages of high theoretical storage capacity, satisfactory reversibility and natural abundance. However, the high thermal stability of Mg–H bonds leads to a high dehydrogenation temperature and sluggish kinetics. The construction of models for examining the interactions of hydrogen with Mg(MgH2) and the catalytic mechanism of catalyst additives is important. Therefore, this paper reviews recent advances in modelling and focuses on first-principles calculation applications in hydrogen adsorption, dissociation and diffusion energy calculations on Mg(0001) and high indexed Mg(101-3) surfaces with element doping, strain and alloy additives. The applications of first-principles calculations on the particle size and dehydrogenation of MgH2 are also reviewed."
Understanding the influence of experimental factors on bio-interactions of nanoparticles: Towards improving correlation between in vitro and in vivo studies,"Bionanotechnology has developed rapidly over the past two decades, owing to the extensive and versatile, functionalities and applicability of nanoparticles (NPs). Fifty-one nanomedicines have been approved by FDA since 1995, out of the many NPs based formulations developed to date. The general conformation of NPs consists of a core with ligands coating their surface, that stabilizes them and provides them with added functionalities. The physicochemical properties, especially the surface composition of NPs influence their bio-interactions to a large extent. This review discusses recent studies that help understand the nano-bio interactions of iron oxide and gold NPs with different surface compositions. We discuss the influence of the experimental factors on the outcome of the studies and, thus, the importance of standardization in the field of nanotechnology. Recent studies suggest that with careful selection of experimental parameters, it is possible to improve the positive correlation between in vitro and in vivo studies. This provides a fundamental understanding of the NPs which helps in assessing their potential toxic side effects and may aid in manipulating them further to improve their biocompatibility and biosafety."
A hierarchical assembly strategy for near-infrared photothermal conversion: Unconventional heterogeneous metalla[2]catenanes,"Herein, we report a hierarchical assembly strategy for constructing heterogeneous half-sandwich organometallic D-A (D = π-donor, A = π-acceptor) interlocked structures, and their application in near-infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion. Thienothiophene and diketopyrrolopyrrole groups were selected as the D and A units, leading to two homogeneous metalla[2]catenanes with D-D-D-D and A-A-A-A stacks, respectively. By the ordered secondary assembly of homogeneous metalla[2]catenanes, two unprecedented heterogeneous D-A metalla[2]catenanes comprising an unusual mixed D-A-D-D and unconventional D-A-A-A stacks were realized by the combination of multiple noncovalent interactions, as all demonstrated by a detailed X-ray crystallographic study. Benefiting from the mixed D-A stacking modes, NIR absorption of heterogeneous D-A metalla[2]catenanes is significantly enhanced in contrast to homogeneous metalla[2]catenanes. Thanks to the enhanced NIR absorption and the fluorescence quenching effect from half-sandwich organometallic fragments, heterogeneous D-A metalla[2]catenanes displayed high-performance NIR photothermal conversion properties (η = 27.3%)."
Interaction Analysis of a Plasmodium falciparum PHISTa-like Protein and PfEMP1 Proteins,"Plasmodium falciparum extensively remodels host cells by translocating numerous proteins into the cytoplasm of red blood cells (RBCs) after invasion. Among these exported proteins, members of the Plasmodium helical interspersed subtelomeric (PHIST) family are crucial for host cell remodeling and host-parasite interactions, and thereby contribute to malaria pathogenesis. Herein, we explored the function of PF3D7_1372300, a member of the PHIST/PHISTa-like subfamily. PF3D7_1372300 was highly transcribed and expressed during the blood stage of P. falciparum, and distributed throughout RBCs, but most abundant at the erythrocyte membrane. Specific interaction of PF3D7_1372300 with the cytoplasmic tail of P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) was revealed by immunofluorescence assay, in vitro intermolecular interaction assays. The interaction sites of PF3D7_1372300 with PfEMP1 ATS domain were found involved more than 30 amino acids (aa) at several positions. The findings deepen our understanding of host-parasite interactions and malaria pathogenesis."
Therapeutic Vaccines for Cancer Immunotherapy,"The rapid development of nanobiotechnology has enabled progress in therapeutic cancer vaccines. These vaccines stimulate the host innate immune response by tumor antigens followed by a cascading adaptive response against cancer. However, an improved antitumor immune response is still in high demand because of the unsatisfactory clinical performance of the vaccine in tumor inhibition and regression. To date, a complicated tumor immunosuppressive environment and suboptimal design are the main obstacles for therapeutic cancer vaccines. The optimization of tumor antigens, vaccine delivery pathways, and proper adjuvants for innate immune response initiation, along with reprogramming of the tumor immunosuppressive environment, is essential for therapeutic cancer vaccines in triggering an adequate antitumor immune response. In this review, we aim to review the challenges in and strategies for enhancing the efficacy of therapeutic vaccines. We start with the summary of the available tumor antigens and their properties and then the optimal strategies for vaccine delivery. Subsequently, the vaccine adjuvants focused on the intrinsic adjuvant properties of nanostructures are further discussed. Finally, we summarize the combination strategies with therapeutic cancer vaccines and discuss their positive impact in cancer immunity."
SERS-Active MIL-100(Fe) Sensory Array for Ultrasensitive and Multiplex Detection of VOCs,"The application of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as SERS-active platforms in multiplex volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detection is still unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that MIL-100 (Fe) serves as an ideal SERS substrate for the detection of VOCs. The limit of detection (LOD) of MIL-100(Fe) for toluene sensing can reach 2.5 ppm, and can be even further decreased to 0.48 ppb level when “hot spots” in between Au nanoparticles are employed onto MIL-100 (Fe) substrate, resulting in an enhancement factor of 1010. Additionally, we show that MIL-100(Fe) substrate has a unique “sensor array” property allowing multiplex VOCs detection, with great modifiability and expandability by doping with foreign metal elements. Finally, the MIL-100(Fe) platform is utilized to simultaneously detect the different gaseous indicators of lung cancer with a ppm detection limit, demonstrating its high potential for early diagnosis of lung cancer in vivo."
A microfluidic chip for screening high-producing hybridomas at single cell level,"Hybridomas are a commonly used, or even the only option, for laboratory study and pilot production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which are crucial for both targeted therapy and biomedical study. A long-term culture of hybridomas will inevitably induce a heterogenization of the whole hybridoma population, resulting in a continuous growth of non-producing hybridomas. To overcome the limits of existing methods of screening heterogeneous hybridomas, in which the whole multi-round screening process is performed in multi-well plates or other discrete modules, this study presents a novel method in which all processing steps of a multi-round hybridoma screening are finished in a single microfluidic chip. This microfluidic chip comprehensively performs hybridoma trapping/proliferating/transferring and fluorescent identification of protein-antibody binding at single cell level. By performing a two-round screening of anti-CD45 mAb secreting hybridomas, the novel microfluidic chip was proved capable of screening several single high-producing hybridomas with minimum cell loss/human labor/time cost, and more importantly, enhanced accuracy and definite monoclonality, which is one of the most important properties of mAb production."
Uracil-DNA-glycosylase-assisted loop-mediated isothermal amplification for detection of bacteria from urine samples with reduced contamination,"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a useful molecular biology technology for analytical applications, but it is prone to contamination because of escaped aerosols, leading to false positive results. This report establishes an integrated, rapid, and accurate method to detect bacteria in urine samples by incorporating uracil-DNA-glycosylase (UDG) into real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). To do this, nucleic acids from five clinically important uropathogens, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterococcus faecalis, were directly captured and concentrated using Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) Elute cards. Following elution, the extracted DNAs were specifically amplified with sets of LAMP primers. The added UDG in the modified LAMP reaction excises uracils from previously amplified products or contaminants and generates apyrimidinic (AP) sites, reducing false positive rates. This UDG-assisted RT LAMP strategy was able to degrade carryover contaminants to as little as 1 femtogram (10-15 g). The assay showed a limit of detection of 104 CFU mL-1 with a sensitivity of 94.1% and a specificity of 95.0%. Both the sensitivity and specificity were improved compared to LAMP carried out without UDG. Our results indicate that the UDG-assisted RT LAMP is of great potential for rapid and precise analysis of nucleic acids in real applications. This journal is"
A bifunctional DNA probe for sensing pH and microRNA using a nanopore,We have developed a bifunctional probe based on triplex molecular beacons for the measurement of environmental pH and quantification of microRNA-10b using a nanopore. The probe responds sharply to solution pH changes in the range of 6.0-7.5. The limit of detection for microRNA-10b is as low as 5.0 pM. This journal is
Density Functional Theory-Based Method to Predict the Activities of Nanomaterials as Peroxidase Mimics,"A wide variety of nanomaterials possess peroxidase-like catalytic activities and show promise as cost-effective and versatile replacements for natural peroxidases. However, a universal tool for predicting the activities of these materials is still lacking, thus hindering the efficient discovery of nanomaterials as peroxidase mimics. Here, we use density functional theory calculations to reveal the peroxidase-mimetic mechanisms for a series of iron-oxide nanosurfaces, and we derive a volcano-shaped plot of catalytic activity as a function of simple energy-based descriptors. The activity curves and the descriptors can be used to predict peroxidase-like activities for not only iron oxides but also other nanomaterials that share similar catalytic mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the method developed herein can systematically predict the peroxidase-like activities of nanomaterials and thus is expected to be of use for computer-aided design of nanomaterial-based peroxidase mimics."
Single-Cell Isotope Dilution Analysis with LA-ICP-MS: A New Approach for Quantification of Nanoparticles in Single Cells,"Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is an emerging method for the analysis of metal nanoparticles (NPs) in single cells. However, two main obstacles, low analytical throughput and lack of commercial reference materials, need to be overcome. In this work, we demonstrated the principles of a new approach termed ""single-cell isotope dilution analysis""(SCIDA) to remove the two obstacles. For a proof of concept, macrophage cells were chosen as a model to study the uptake of silver NPs (AgNPs) at a single-cell level. Single cells exposed to AgNPs were placed in an array by a microfluidic technique; each cell in the array was precisely dispensed with a known picoliter droplet of an enriched isotope solution with a commercial inkjet printer; accurate quantification of AgNPs in single cells was done by using isotope dilution LA-ICP-MS. The average Ag mass of 1100 single cells, 396 ± 219 fg Ag per cell, was in good accord with the average of the population of cells determined by solution ICP-MS analysis. The detection limit was 0.2 fg Ag per cell. The SCIDA approach is expected to be widely applied for the study of cell-NP interactions and biological effects of NPs at the single-cell level."
Sustainable use of nanomaterials in textiles and their environmental impact,"At present, nanotechnology is a priority in research in several nations due to its massive capability and financial impact. However, due to the uncertainties and abnormalities in shape, size, and chemical compositions, the existence of certain nanomaterials may lead to dangerous effects on the human health and environment. The present review includes the different advanced applications of nanomaterials in textiles industries, as well as their associated environmental and health risks. The four main textile industry fields using nanomaterials, nanofinishing, nanocoatings, nanofibers, and nanocomposites, are analyzed. Different functional textiles with nanomaterials are also briefly reviewed. Most textile materials are in direct and prolonged contact with our skin. Hence, the influence of carcinogenic and toxic substances that are available in textiles must be comprehensively examined. Proper recognition of the conceivable benefits and accidental hazards of nanomaterials to our surroundings is significant for pursuing its development in the forthcoming years. The conclusions of the current paper are anticipated to increase awareness on the possible influence of nanomaterial-containing textile wastes and the significance of better regulations in regards to the ultimate disposal of these wastes."
Probing the immune responses to nanoparticles across environmental species. A perspective of the EU Horizon 2020 project PANDORA,"Understanding how engineered nanomaterials affect immune responses of living organisms requires a strong collaborative effort between immunologists, toxicologists, ecologists, physiologists, inorganic chemists, nanomaterial scientists and experts in law and risk management. This perspective aims to provide a new viewpoint on the interaction between engineered nanomaterials and the immune defensive systems across living species, gained within the EU Horizon 2020 project PANDORA. We consider the effects of nanoparticle exposure on immune functions in plants, marine and terrestrial invertebrates and their relation to the current state of knowledge for vertebrates (in particular humans). These studies can shed light on the broader perspective of defensive and homeostatic mechanisms (immunity, inflammation, stress responses, microbiota, stem cell differentiation) suggesting ways to: i) perform a comparative analysis of the nanoparticle impact on immunity across model organisms; ii) inspire best practices in experimental methodologies for nanosafety/nanotoxicity studies; iii) regroup and harmonise fragmented research activities; iv) improve knowledge transfer strategies and nano-security; v) propose innovative tools and realistic solutions, thereby helping in identifying future research needs and tackling their challenges.

Potential of nanonutraceuticals in increasing immunity,"Nutraceuticals are defined as foods or their extracts that have a demonstrably positive effect on human health. According to the decision of the European Food Safety Authority, this positive effect, the so-called health claim, must be clearly demonstrated best by performed tests. Nutraceuticals include dietary supplements and functional foods. These special foods thus affect human health and can positively affect the immune system and strengthen it even in these turbulent times, when the human population is exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these special foods are supplemented with nanoparticles of active substances or processed into nanoformulations. The benefits of nanoparticles in this case include enhanced bioavailability, controlled release, and increased stability. Lipid-based delivery systems and the encapsulation of nutraceuticals are mainly used for the enrichment of food products with these health-promoting compounds. This contribution summarizes the current state of the research and development of effective nanonutraceuticals influencing the body’s immune responses, such as vitamins (C, D, E, B12, folic acid), minerals (Zn, Fe, Se), antioxidants (carotenoids, coenzyme Q10, polyphenols, curcumin), omega-3 fatty acids, and probiotics."
Understanding nanoparticle toxicity to direct a safe-by-design approach in cancer nanomedicine,"Nanomedicine is a rapidly growing field that uses nanomaterials for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of various diseases, including cancer. Various biocompatible nanoplatforms with diversified capabilities for tumor targeting, imaging, and therapy have materialized to yield individualized therapy. However, due to their unique properties brought about by their small size, safety concerns have emerged as their physicochemical properties can lead to altered pharmacokinetics, with the potential to cross biological barriers. In addition, the intrinsic toxicity of some of the inorganic materials (i.e., heavy metals) and their ability to accumulate and persist in the human body has been a challenge to their translation. Successful clinical translation of these nanoparticles is heavily dependent on their stability, circulation time, access and bioavailability to disease sites, and their safety profile. This review covers preclinical and clinical inorganic-nanoparticle based nanomaterial utilized for cancer imaging and therapeutics. A special emphasis is put on the rational design to develop non-toxic/safe inorganic nanoparticle constructs to increase their viability as translatable nanomedicine for cancer therapies."
Interplanar Growth of 2D Non-Van der Waals Co<inf>2</inf>N-Based Heterostructures for Efficient Overall Water Splitting,"The design and synthesis of 2D heterostructured materials for water splitting are normally based on van der Waals (vdW) nanosheets, but this approach is gradually approaching a performance ceiling in terms of activity and stability. Herein, a novel heterostructured system is explored based on 2D non-vdW and conductive nanosheets. Notably, the interplanar growth of 2D non-vdW Co2N nanosheets is realized between graphene layers in the current collector of carbon fiber papers (CPs), generating an interlocking structure within CPs. The exposed surface of Co2N nanosheets possesses a high surface energy that anchors highly active CoNC, forming 2D CoNC@Co2N heterostructures outside CPs. This integrated electrocatalytic system bridged by non-vdW Co2N nanosheets presents a low overpotential of 1.52 V and an excellent stability of 280 h, which outperform most bifunctional and nonprecious-metal-based electrocatalysts in alkaline media, owing to the nature of 2D non-vdW nanosheets and the formation of strong and conductive connections among CoNC, nanosheets, and CPs."
Multiparametric Profiling of Engineered Nanomaterials: Unmasking the Surface Coating Effect,"Despite considerable efforts, the properties that drive the cytotoxicity of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) remain poorly understood. Here, the authors inverstigate a panel of 31 ENMs with different core chemistries and a variety of surface modifications using conventional in vitro assays coupled with omics-based approaches. Cytotoxicity screening and multiplex-based cytokine profiling reveals a good concordance between primary human monocyte-derived macrophages and the human monocyte-like cell line THP-1. Proteomics analysis following a low-dose exposure of cells suggests a nonspecific stress response to ENMs, while microarray-based profiling reveals significant changes in gene expression as a function of both surface modification and core chemistry. Pathway analysis highlights that the ENMs with cationic surfaces that are shown to elicit cytotoxicity downregulated DNA replication and cell cycle responses, while inflammatory responses are upregulated. These findings are validated using cell-based assays. Notably, certain small, PEGylated ENMs are found to be noncytotoxic yet they induce transcriptional responses reminiscent of viruses. In sum, using a multiparametric approach, it is shown that surface chemistry is a key determinant of cellular responses to ENMs. The data also reveal that cytotoxicity, determined by conventional in vitro assays, does not necessarily correlate with transcriptional effects of ENMs."
One-step synthesis of the reduced graphene oxide@NiO composites for supercapacitor electrodes by electrode-assisted plasma electrolysis,"An electrode-assisted plasma electrolysis is developed to synthesize the reduced graphene oxide@NiO (rGO@NiO) composites as supercapacitor electrode materials. The method is fast and efficient, realizing one-step synthesis for the rGO@NiO composites. The composition, morphologies, electrochemical properties, and deposition dynamics of rGO@NiO composites are systematically investigated in current work. The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectra show that NiO is synthesized on the rGO. The weight ratio of NiO in the rGO@NiO composites is about 50.2% by thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) exhibits that lots of nanoparticles distribute uniformly relatively on the rGO, and the diameter of nanoparticles is mostly in 30–80 nm. The as-prepared rGO@NiO composite displays a specific capacitance of 1093 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1 current density. In addition, it exhibits an excellent cycle stability, and still keeps ~87% of the original capacitance and 90.6% coulombic efficiency after 5000 cycles. Based on the electrochemical theory, the electrode-assisted plasma electrolysis process is dominated by the electrochemical polarization, shortening the deposition process and realizing a fast synthesis for the rGO@NiO composites. The synthesis method, electrode-assisted plasma electrolysis, presents a promising route for the efficient and rapid preparation of rGO-metal oxide composites as energy storage materials."
Trends in nanoformulations for atopic dermatitis treatment,"Introduction: Immunological skin dysfunctions trigger the synthesis and release of inflammatory cytokines, which induce recurrent skin inflammation associated with chronic itching, inefficient barrier behavior, and reduced skin hydration. These features characterize a multifactorial chronic inflammatory disease atopic dermatitis (AD). AD therapy includes anti-inflammatory drugs and immunosuppressors as well as non-pharmacological alternatives such as emollients, moisturizers, and lipids (ceramides, phospholipids) for modulating the skin hydration and the barrier repair. However, these treatments are inconvenient with low drug skin penetration and insufficient maintenance on the application site. Areas covered: Nanotechnology-based therapies can be a great strategy to overcome these limitations. Considering the particular skin morphological organization, SC lipid matrix composition, and immunological functions/features related to nanocarriers, this review focuses on recent developments of nanoparticulate systems (polymeric, lipid-based, inorganic) as parent or hybrid systems including their chemical composition, physico-chemical and biopharmaceutical properties, and differential characteristics that evaluate them as new effective drug-delivery systems for AD treatment. Expert opinion: Despite the several innovative formulations, research in nanotechnology-based carriers should address specific aspects such as the use of moisturizers associated to pharmacological therapies, toxicity studies, scale-up production processes and the nanocarrier influence on immunological response. These approaches will help researchers choose the most appropriate nanocarrier system and widen nanomedicine applications and commercialization."
Silver nanoparticle-activated COX2/PGE2 axis involves alteration of lung cellular senescence in vitro and in vivo,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used as antimicrobial agents and resulted in their accumulation in environment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying AgNP-induced lung cellular senescence which has been proposed as a pathogenic driver of chronic lung disease. Herein, we demonstrate that exposure to AgNPs elevates multiple senescence biomarkers in lung cells, with cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, and potently activates genes of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in human fetal lung fibroblast cell line MRC5. Fluorescence-based assay also reveals that apoptosis induced by AgNPs is associated with senescence. Furthermore, we show that AgNPs cause premature senescence through an increase in transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) expression and over-production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in lung cells. Inhibition of COX2 reduces AgNPs-induced senescence to a normal level. Moreover, AgNPs also induce upregulation of COX2 and accelerate lung cellular senescence in vivo and cause mild fibrosis in the lung tissue of mice. Taken together, our studies support a critical role of AgNPs in the induction of lung cellular senescence via the upregulation of the COX2/PGE2 intracrine pathway, and suggest the adverse effects to the human respiratory system."
Fluorescent carbon dots are the new quantum dots: an overview of their potential in emerging technologies and nanosafety,"Carbon dots (CDs) have become a potential material for biosensing, drug delivery, and bioimaging because of their strong fluorescence, for which they are referred to as fluorescent carbon dots. CDs have drawn significant attention as a new class of carbonaceous nanomaterials with accelerating applications in varying different technologies. This attention is mainly based on a multitude of appealing properties of CDs, such as high hydrophilicity, biodegradability, biocompatibility, chemical stability, and ease of surface modification, together with their unique optic properties. In this review, CDs were classified and evaluated based on the difference in precursors and preparation methods. The synthetic methods of CDs were summarized, and their luminescence mechanism was analyzed. The applications of CDs in biosensing, drug delivery, energy, and bioimaging were also discussed. The issues and challenges of CDs were analyzed for their further development, with specific emphasis on the toxicity profiles or lack thereof, especially that of cytotoxicity and long-term genotoxicity developed secondary to nanotoxic effects, of carbon dot-based systems. Additional research in toxicity is sure to lead to improved baseline nanosafety statistics for CDs and will be a crucial determinant in the adoption of CDs into many fields across all scientific disciplines, as well as indirectly assist in the development of more efficient and cost-effective technologies. Suggestions for the development of the concepts contemplated herein were also provided, along with additional insight into the controversy concerning the phenomenon of emission and the upconverted photoluminescence."
"Fabrication, functionalization and performance of doped photocatalysts for dye degradation and mineralization: a review","Textile wastewaters contain refractory dyes that cause pollution and socio-economic issues, thus calling for efficient remediation techniques such as photocatalysis. We review the fabrication, functionalization, performance and limitations of doped catalysts for degrading and mineralizing dyes. We present developments in photocatalyst immobilization and photocatalytic reactor design. Methods such as microwave irradiation, sonication and use of ionic liquids are emerging for the preparation of doped photocatalysts. Whilst single-dye systems have been extensively studied, there is limited knowledge on multiple-dye systems. Immobilization of photocatalysts is gaining popularity for large-scale application, but faces issues of erosion, corrosion, mechanical strength and structure integrity. Ecotoxicological studies are required in real environments to validate the potential applications of nanostructured doped photocatalysts."
Acute toxicity of Zinc Oxide nanoparticles to silkworm (Bombyx mori L.),"Zinc Oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) has been heavily used in the industry, and increasing concerns on the ecotoxicity has arisen due to the risk of release into the environment. In this work, silkworm was used here as a model organism to study the toxicity of ZnO NPs, due to the presence of a conserved immune response as well as a pharmacokinetics similar to mammals. Zn accumulation, biodistribution and toxicity in silkworms were monitored at different time points after a subcutaneous injection. The highest cumulative content of ZnO NPs was detected in the midgut. The results of catalytic activity studies confirmed that the antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GSH-PX) in midgut cells were expressed in response to ZnO NPs. The expression of genes (Dronc and Caspase-1) related to apoptosis was increased, while the Trt gene was down-regulated. A possible mechanism was proposed for toxicity of ZnO NPs to silkworms."
Biogenic nanoparticles as immunomodulator for tumor treatment,"In the past few decades, cancer immunotherapy has developed rapidly. Cancer immunotherapy, either used alone or in combination with a variety of immunotherapies (such as cancer therapeutic vaccines, adoptive cell therapy, or immune checkpoint blocking therapy), is a very attractive class of cancer therapy. However, so far, the clinical effect of most cancer immunotherapy is not satisfactory. It has been widely recognized that nanotechnology can enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. A variety of biogenic nanoparticles have been developed, which have excellent immunogenicity and modifiability, and can carry tumor therapeutic drugs to achieve combined therapy, so as to improve the effectiveness and durability of antitumor immunity while reducing adverse side effects. In this review, we summarized the key parameters and futures of three kinds of biogenic nanomaterials in cancer immunotherapy; we highlighted the progress of cancer immunotherapy based on outer membrane vesicles, virus-like particles, and exosomes. This article is categorized under: Therapeutic Approaches and Drug Discovery > Nanomedicine for Oncologic Disease Nanotechnology Approaches to Biology > Nanoscale Systems in Biology."
Structure-activity prediction networks (SAPNets): A step beyond Nano-QSAR for effective implementation of the safe-by-design concept,"A significant number of experimental studies are supported by computational methods such as quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling of nanoparticles (Nano-QSAR). This is especially so in research focused on design and synthesis of new, safer nanomaterials using safe-by-design concepts. However, Nano-QSAR has a number of important limitations. For example, it is not clear which descriptors that describe the nanoparticle physicochemical and structural properties are essential and can be adjusted to alter the target properties. This limitation can be overcome with the useof the Structure-Activity Prediction Network (SAPNet) presented in this paper. There are three mainphases of building the SAPNet. First, information about the structural characterization of a nanomaterial, its physical and chemical properties and toxicity is compiled. Then, the most relevant properties (intrinsic/extrinsic) likely to influence the ENM toxicity are identified by developing ""meta-models"". Finally, these ""meta-models""describing the dependencies between themost relevant properties of the ENMs and their adverse biological properties are developed. In thisway, the network is built layer by layer from the endpoint (e.g. toxicity or other properties of interest) to descriptors that describe the particle structure. Therefore, SAPNets go beyond the current standards and provide sufficient information on what structural features should be altered to obtain a material with desired properties."
Artificial nanotargeted cells with stable photothermal performance for multimodal imaging-guided tumor-specific therapy,"Organic−inorganic hybrid materials have drawn increasing attention as photothermal agents in tumor therapy due to the advantages of green synthesis, high loading efficiency of hydrophobic drugs, facile incorporation of theranostic iron, and excellent photothermal efficiency without inert components or additives. Herein, we proposed a strategy for biomimetic engineering-mediated enhancement of photothermal performance in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This strategy is based on the specific characteristics of organic−inorganic hybrid materials and endows these materials with homologous targeting ability and photothermal stability in the TME. The hybrid materials perform the functions of cancer cells to target homolytic tumors (acting as “artificial nanotargeted cells (ANTC)”). Inspired by the pH-dependent disassembly behaviors of tannic acid (TA) and ferric ion (FeIII) and subsequent attenuation of photothermal performance, cancer cell membranes were self-deposited onto the surfaces of protoporphyrin-encapsulated TA and FeIII nanoparticles to achieve ANTC with TME-stable photothermal performance and tumor-specific phototherapy. The resulting ANTC can be used as contrast agents for concurrent photoacoustic imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, and photothermal imaging to guide the treatment. Importantly, the high loading efficiency of protoporphyrin enables the initiation of photodynamic therapy to enhance photothermal therapeutic efficiency, providing antitumor function with minimal side effects."
Suppressing the radiation-induced corrosion of bismuth nanoparticles for enhanced synergistic cancer radiophototherapy,"The level of tumor killing by bismuth nanoparticles (BiNPs) as radiosensitizers depends strongly on the powerful particle-matter interaction. However, this same radiation leads to the structural damage in BiNPs, consequently weakening their specific physicochemical properties for radiosensitization. Herein, we studied the radiation-induced corrosion behavior of BiNPs and demonstrated that these damages were manifested by the change in their morphology and crystal structure as well as self-oxidation at their surface. Furthermore, artificial heterostructures were created with graphene nanosheets to greatly suppress the radiation-induced corrosion in BiNPs and enhance their radiocatalytic activity for radiotherapy enhancement. Such a nanocomposite allows the accumulation of overexpressed glutathione, a natural hole scavenger, at the reaction interfaces. This enables the rapid removal of radiogenerated holes from the surface of BiNPs and minimizes the self-radiooxidation, therefore resulting in an efficient suppression of radiation corrosion and a decrease of the depletion of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Meanwhile, the radioexcited conduction band electrons react with the high-level H2O2 within cancer cells to yield more ROS, and the secondary electrons are trapped by H2O molecules to produce hydrated electrons capable of reducing a highly oxidized species such as cytochrome c. These radiochemical reactions together with hyperthermia can regulate the tumor microenvironment and accelerate the onset of cellular redox disequilibrium, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA damage, finally triggering tumor apoptosis and death. The current work will shed light on radiosensitizers with an enhanced corrosion resistance for controllable and synergistic radio-phototherapeutics."
Gold nanorod-based nanoplatform catalyzes constant no generation and protects from cardiovascular injury,"Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death, and one of the effective therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular disease is to provide a controlled, constant supply of nitric oxide (NO) in a mild manner; however, this has proved challenging in the clinic. To address this problem, we built a nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-like nanoplatform (NanoNOS) that consists of a noble metal nanoparticle core and a mesoporous silica shell and demonstrated the ability of NanoNOS to catalyze production of NO in vitro. Mechanistic studies show that the catalysis consists of a three-step reaction: The oxidation of NADPH to produce O2 - via oxidase-like activity and the subsequent dismutation of O2 - to H2O2 via SOD-like activity, followed by H2O2-mediated oxidation of L-arginine to produce NO via a nonenzymatic pathway. The generation of NO is precisely regulated by both the content of the NanoNOS species and the plasmon excitation. We found that NanoNOS greatly suppressed injury-driven monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion, suggesting the NanoNOS treatment could help prevent cardiovascular disease. With such a design as well as plasmon excitation that allows for controlled and constant catalytic activity, NanoNOS technology could have a variety of biomedical applications."
In vivo real-time pharmaceutical evaluations of near-infrared II fluorescent nanomedicine bound polyethylene glycol ligands for tumor photothermal ablation,"Pharmaceutical evaluations of nanomedicines are of great significance for their further launch into industry and clinic. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging plays essential roles in preclinical drug development by providing important insights into the biodistributions of drugs in vivo with deep tissue penetration and high spatiotemporal resolution. However, NIR-II fluorescence imaging has rarely been exploited for in vivo real-time pharmaceutical evaluations of nanomedicine. Herein, we developed a highly emissive NIR-II luminophore to establish a versatile nanoplatform to noninvasively monitor the in vivo metabolism of nanomedicines bound various polyethylene glycol (PEG) ligands in a real-time manner. An alternative D-A-D conjugated oligomer (DTTB) was synthesized to achieve NIR-II emission peaked at ∼1050 nm with high fluorescence QYs of 13.4% and a large absorption coefficient. By anchoring with the DTTB molecule, intrinsically fluorescent micelles were fabricated and bound with PEG ligands at various chain lengths. In vivo NIR-II fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging results revealed that an appropriate PEG chain length could effectively contribute to the longer blood circulation and better tumor targeting. In vivo therapeutic experiments also confirmed the optimized nanomedicines have efficient photothermal elimination of tumors and good biosafety. This work offered an alternative highly fluorescent NIR-II material and demonstrated a promising approach for realtime pharmaceutical evaluation of nanomedicine in vivo."
Phenol removal from wastewater by surface imprinted bacterial cellulose nanofibres,"In this study, we have reported a novel wastewater treatment technique by phenol imprinted bacterial cellulose (BC-MIP) nanofibres with high specificity and adsorption capacity. N-methacryloyl-(L) phenylalanine methyl ester (MAPA) functional monomer was used to create specific binding sites for the template molecule phenol via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. BC-MIP nanofibres were synthesized by surface imprinting approach in the presence of different amounts of total monomer (% weight), monomer/template ratio and polymerization time. Then, the nanofibres were characterized by FTIR-ATR, surface area analysis (BET), elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and contact angle measurements. Adsorption studies were performed with respect to pH, temperature and ionic strength, and the adsorption capacity was calculated by using the spectrophotometer. In order to desorb the adsorbed phenol from BC-MIP nanofibres, 0.1 M NaCl solution was used. Besides, BC-MIP nanofibres were applied to real wastewater samples from Ergene basin in Turkey. The suitable equilibrium isotherm was determined as Langmuir isotherm. To evaluate the selectivity of the BC-MIP nanofibres, similar molecules were utilized as competitor molecules, which were 2-chlorophenol, 4-chlorophenol and 2,4-dichlorophenol. Electrostatic interactions were found to contribute to the generation of specific recognition binding sites. The results have shown that imprinting of phenol was achieved successfully with high adsorption capacity. The phenol removal efficiency was reported up to 97%. BC-MIP nanofibres were used 10 times with a negligible decrease in adsorption capacity."
Desuccinylation-Triggered Peptide Self-Assembly: Live Cell Imaging of SIRT5 Activity and Mitochondrial Activity Modulation,"Mimicking nature's ability to orchestrate molecular self-assembly in living cells is important yet challenging. Molecular self-assembly has found wide applications in cellular activity control, drug delivery, biomarker imaging, etc. Nonetheless, examples of suborganelle-confined supramolecular self-assembly are quite rare and research in this area remains challenging. Herein, we have presented a new strategy to program supramolecular self-assembly specifically in mitochondria by leveraging on a unique enzyme SIRT5. SIRT5 is a mitochondria-localized enzyme belonging to a family of NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases. Accumulating studies suggest that SIRT5 is involved in regulating diverse biological processes, such as reactive oxygen defense, fatty acid metabolism, and apoptosis. In this study, we designed a novel class of succinylated peptide precursors that can be transformed into self-assembling building blocks through SIRT5 catalysis, leading to the formation of supramolecular nanofibers in vitro and in living cells. The increased hydrophobicity arising from self-assembly remarkably enhanced the fluorescence of nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) in the nanofibers. With this approach, we have enabled activity-based imaging of SIRT5 in living cells for the first time. Moreover, SIRT5-mediated peptide self-assembly was found to depolarize mitochondria membrane potential and promote ROS formation. Coincubation of the peptide with three different chemotherapeutic agents significantly boosted the anticancer activities of these drugs. Our work has thus illustrated a new way of mitochondria-confined peptide self-assembly for SIRT5 imaging and potential anticancer treatment."
Amination of the Gd@C<inf>82</inf>endohedral fullerene: Tunable substitution effect on quantum coherence behaviors,"The core-shell structure of endohedral fullerene-based anisotropic magnetic molecules of high spin with long coherence time could help scale up quantum systems. In this research, by amination of Gd@C82 with morpholine, three derivatives are functionalized with 5, 7 and 9 morpholine groups providing an interesting model to investigate the relationship between the quantum coherence and the spin environment. The original radical located on the carbon cage is successfully quenched, affording a quantum phase memory times (TM) over 5 μs at 5 K. By increasing the number of substitution groups, spin-lattice relaxation times (T1) also show significant enhancement due to the interaction variation between the molecules and the environments. We found that the TM of the three molecules show no obvious difference below 10 K, while they are limited by T1 at higher temperatures. In this work, the variable functional groups are able to tune both T1 and TM, offering the possibility for application of high-spin magnetic molecules in the field of quantum information processing.

Amphiphilic Block Copolymers-Guided Strategies for Assembling Nanoparticles: From Basic Construction Methods to Bioactive Agent Delivery Applications,"Over recent decades, amphiphilic block copolymers (ABCs) comprising both hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments within their covalently bound structure have been extensively investigated from basic science to various biomedical applications. Nanoparticles (NPs) self-assembled from ABCs have been a center of interest for controlled delivery of various therapeutic drugs, genes, proteins, and imaging agents for decades and continue to attract attention owing to their unique physical and biological properties. In this Spotlight on Applications, we review and summarize recent optimized preparation techniques in the fabrication of ""drugs""-loaded NPs from ABCs based on our group progress. These techniques can be categorized into four types including (i) emulsification and solvent evaporation, (ii) double emulsification and solvent evaporation, (iii) nanoprecipitation, and (iv) film dispersion. By selecting proper techniques, bioactive agents with different properties could be incorporated into the NPs either alone or in a combination pattern. We analyze the parameters of various techniques and specifically we highlight the improvements on the improved techniques to simultaneously coload both hydrophilic/hydrophobic drugs and therapeutic nucleic acids in the single NPs. These techniques will allow researchers to select proper methods in designing ""drugs""-loaded NPs from ABCs."
Detection of Pb(II): Au Nanoparticle Incorporated CuBTC MOFs,"In the present investigation, copper benzene tricarboxylate metal organic frameworks (CuBTC MOF) and Au nanoparticle incorporated CuBTC MOF (Au@CuBTC) were synthesized by the conventional solvothermal method in a round bottom flask at 105°C and kept in an oil bath. The synthesized CuBTC MOF and Au@CuBTC MOFs were characterized by structure using X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopic methods including Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). We also characterized them using morphological techniques such as Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and electrochemical approaches that included cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We examined thermal stability by thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DTA) and N2 adsorption—desorption isotherm by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area method. Both materials were tested for the detection of lead (II) ions in aqueous media. Au nanoparticle incorporated CuBTC MOF showed great affinity and selectivity toward Pb2+ ions and achieved a lower detection limit (LOD) of 1 nM/L by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique, which is far below than MCL for Pb2+ ions (0.03 μM/L) suggested by the United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) drinking water regulations."
"Cytotoxicity of hexabromocyclododecane, 1,2-dibromo-4-(1,2-dibromoethyl) cyclohexane and 1,2,5,6-tetrabromocyclooctane in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells","With the listing of the of cycloaliphatic brominated flame retardants (CBFR) hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) as a persistent organic pollutant (POP) by the Stockholm Convention, much attention has been paid to the environmental behaviors and biological effects of HBCD, as well as its potential alternatives, such as 1,2-dibromo-4-(1,2-dibromoethyl) cyclohexane (TBECH) and 1,2,5,6-tetrabromocyclooctane (TBCO). In this study, the neurotoxicity of HBCD, TBECH, and TBCO in human SH-SY5Y cells were compared. The results showed that HBCD, TBECH, and TBCO induced cytotoxicity, including dose–dependent cell viability decreases, cell membrane permeability increases, cytoskeleton development damage, and apoptosis induction, with the cytotoxicity in the order of HBCD > TBCO > TBECH. The expression levels of apoptotic proteins (caspase-3, Bax, caspase-9, Bcl-2, and cytochrome c (Cyt c)) followed the same order, which indicated that mitochondrial apoptotic pathway may be one of the mechanisms responsible for their neurotoxicity. In order to study the mechanisms of cytotoxicity, CBFRs-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the intracellular calcium levels were determined. The ROS levels were significantly elevated for three CBFRs treatment, suggesting that oxidative stress contributes to their cytotoxicity. The intracellular calcium concentrations were significantly enhanced for HBCD and TBCO treatment, but not for TBECH, indicating that in addition to ROS, cytotoxicity of HBCD and TBCO may follow Ca2+-mediated apoptotic pathway. This study first compared the neurotoxicity of different CBFRs, providing valuable information for their risk assessment."
Chromium-based metal-organic framework embedded with cobalt phthalocyanine for the sensitively impedimetric cytosensing of colorectal cancer (CT26) cells and cell imaging,"In this study, we have prepared the series of nanohybrids of Cr-based metal-organic framework (Cr-MOF) and cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) nanoparticles (denoted as Cr-MOF@CoPc) and investigated them as novel platforms of electrochemical cytosensors for determining colorectal cancer (CT26) cells. The developed Cr-MOF@CoPc nanohybrids were composed of irregularly small nanoparticles, mixed metal valence states of Cr2+/Cr3+/Cr5+ and Co2+/Co3+, rich functional groups of C–O and COO and strong fluorescence performance, as well as high specific area and large pore volume. These intrinsic features of Cr-MOF@CoPc nanohybrids endowed them with strong immobilization ability toward aptamer strands via π- π* stacking, electrostatic interaction, and van der Waals force, excellent electrochemical property, strong fluorescence intensity, and good biocompatibility. Compared with cytosensors based on the sole metal MOFs (Cr-MOF and CoPc) and other reported bulk MOF-based sensors, the constructed Cr-MOF@CoPc-based cytosensor exhibited low detection limit toward CT26 cells, for which the sensing performance was modulated by changing the dosage of CoPc nanoparticles. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and differential pulse voltammetry results showed extremely low detection limits of 36 and 8 cells mL−1, respectively, within the concentration range of the CT26 cell suspension (50–1 × 107 cells mL−1), along with high selectivity, excellent stability, and acceptable reproducibility. Thus, the prepared cytosensor can be extensively applied for the analysis of other kinds of cancer cells when anchored their corresponding aptamer strands, providing great potential applications in the biosensor and biomedical fields."
Enzyme-Regulated Peptide-Liquid Metal Hybrid Hydrogels as Cell Amber for Single-Cell Manipulation,"Current strategies to construct cell-based bioartificial tissues largely remain on a multicell level. Taking cell diversity into account, single-cell manipulation is urgently needed for delicate bioartificial tissue construction. Current single-cell isolation and profiling techniques involve invasive processes and thus are not applicable for single-cell manipulation. Here, we managed to fabricate peptide-liquid metal hybrid hydrogels as ""cell ambers"" which were suitable for single-cell isolation as well as further handling. The successful preparation of uniform liquid metal nanoparticles allowed the fabrication of peptide-liquid metal hydrogel with excellent recovery property upon mechanical destruction. The alkaline phosphatase-instructed supramolecular self-assembly process allowed the formation of microhydrogel post-filling in the PDMS template. The co-culture of the hydrogel precursor and mammalian cells realized the embedding of cells into elastic hydrogels which were the so-called cell ambers. The cell ambers turned out to be biocompatible and capable of supporting cell survival. Aided with the micro-operating system and a laser scanning confocal microscope, we could arrange these as-prepared 3D single-cell ambers into various patterns as desired. Our strategy provided the possibility to manipulate a single cell, which served as a prototype of cell architecture toward cell-based bioartificial tissue construction."
Preparing dangling bonds by nanoholes on graphene oxide nanosheets and their enhanced magnetism,"The effects of dangling bonds on the magnetic properties of graphene oxide (GO) were studied experimentally by creating nanoholes on GO nanosheets. GO with more nanoholes (MHGO) and less nanoholes (LHGO) on graphene oxide nanosheets were synthesized. Results showed that nanoholes brought new dangling bonds for GO and the increase of the dangling bonds on GO could be adjusted by the amounts of the nanoholes on GO. The magnetism of GO was enhanced with increased density of nanoholes on GO (MHGO > LHGO > GO). Furthermore, the increased dangling bonds induced magnetic coupling between the spin units and so converted paramagnetism GO to ferromagnetism (MHGO, LHGO). The easy generation and adjustment of GO dangling bonds by nanoholes on GO nanosheets will promote the applications of GO."
Carbon footprint of a port infrastructure from a life cycle approach,"One of the most important consequences caused by the constant development of human activity is the uncontrolled generation of greenhouse gases (GHG). The main gases (CO2, CH4, and N2O) are illustrated by the carbon footprint. To determine the impact of port infrastructures, a Life Cycle Assessment approach is applied that considers construction and maintenance. A case study of a port infrastructure in Spain is analyzed. Main results reflect the continuous emission of GHG throughout the useful life of the infrastructure (25 years). Both machinery (85%) and materials (15%) are key elements influencing the obtained results (117,000 Tm CO2e)."
Risk management framework for nano-biomaterials used in medical devices and advanced therapy medicinal products,"The convergence of nanotechnology and biotechnology has led to substantial advancements in nano-biomaterials (NBMs) used in medical devices (MD) and advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP). However, there are concerns that applications of NBMs for medical diagnostics, therapeutics and regenerative medicine could also pose health and/or environmental risks since the current understanding of their safety is incomplete. A scientific strategy is therefore needed to assess all risks emerging along the life cycles of these products. To address this need, an overarching risk management framework (RMF) for NBMs used in MD and ATMP is presented in this paper, as a result of a collaborative effort of a team of experts within the EU Project BIORIMA and with relevant inputs from external stakeholders. The framework, in line with current regulatory requirements, is designed according to state-of-the-art approaches to risk assessment and management of both nanomaterials and biomaterials. The collection/generation of data for NBMs safety assessment is based on innovative integrated approaches to testing and assessment (IATA). The framework can support stakeholders (e.g., manufacturers, regulators, consultants) in systematically assessing not only patient safety but also occupational (including healthcare workers) and environmental risks along the life cycle of MD and ATMP. The outputs of the framework enable the user to identify suitable safe(r)-by-design alternatives and/or risk management measures and to compare the risks of NBMs to their (clinical) benefits, based on efficacy, quality and cost criteria, in order to inform robust risk management decision-making."
Live cells process exogenous peptide as fibronectin fibrillogenesis in vivo,"The human body is one of the most sophisticated material systems. It is still a considerable challenge to biomimic the ""life-design"" process to construct a part of ""life"" in vivo. Herein, we mimicked the natural fibronectin (FN) fibrillogenesis system using ligand-receptor interaction-induced self-assembly to construct in situ artificial fibrous FN in vivo, based on exogenous FN mimic peptide (FNMP). We performed the in vivo study with a tumor-bearing mouse model, to which the particle formulated FNMP raw materials were delivered with high efficiency to the tumor site through intravenous (iv) administration. In the tumor, the presence of overexpressed integrin receptors on the cell surface induced the self-assembly of the FNMP into fibrous structures, thereby, creating an artificial fibrous FN. However, the FNMP-based artificial fibrous FN showed different biological functionality from the natural fibrous FN, inhibiting the growth and migration of cells, making our constructed FN able to inhibit tumor growth,invasion, and metastasis. Thus, this study opens an avenue for the precise construction of biomimetic materials for in vivo biomedical applications."
Safe(r) by design implementation in the nanotechnology industry,"The implementation of Safe(r) by Design (SbD) in industrial innovations requires an integrated approach where the human, environmental and economic impact of the SbD measures is evaluated across and throughout the nanomaterial (NM) life cycle. SbD was implemented in six industrial companies where SbD measures were applied to NMs, nano-enabled products (NEPs) and NM/NEP manufacturing processes. The approach considers human and environmental risks, functionality of the NM/NEP and costs as early as possible in the innovation process, continuing throughout the innovation progresses. Based on the results of the evaluation, a decision has to be made on whether to continue, stop or re-design the NM/NEP/process or to carry out further tests/obtain further data in cases where the uncertainty of the human and environmental risks is too large. However, SbD can also be implemented at later stages when there is already a prototype product or process available, as demonstrated in some of the cases. The SbD measures implemented in some of the case studies did not result in a viable solution. For example the coating of silicon nanoparticles with amorphous carbon increased the conductivity, the stability and reduced the dustiness of the particles and therefore the risk of explosion and the exposure to workers. However the socioeconomic assessment for their use in lithium-ion batteries for cars, when compared to the use of graphite, showed that the increase in performance did not overcome the higher production costs. This work illustrates the complexities of selecting the most appropriate SbD measures and highlights that SbD cannot be solely based on a hazard and exposure assessment but must include other impacts that any SbD measures may have on sustainability including energy consumption and waste generation as well as all associated monetary costs."
Lipid and protein corona of food-grade TiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles in simulated gastrointestinal digestion,"In the presence of biological matrices, engineered nanomaterials, such as TiO2, develop a biomolecular corona composed of lipids, proteins, etc. In this study, we analyzed the biocorona formed on the food grade TiO2 (E171) going through an in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion system in either a fasting food model (FFM), a standardized food model (SFM), or a high fat food model (HFFM). Lipids and proteins were extracted from the biocorona and underwent untargeted lipidomic and label-free shotgun proteomic analyses. Our results showed that the biocorona composition was different before and after food digestion. After digestion, more diverse lipids were adsorbed compared to proteins, most of which were the enzymes added to the simulated digestion system. The corona lipid profile was distinct from the digested food model they presented in, although similarity in the lipid profiles between the corona and the food matrix increased with the fat content in the food model. The corona formed in the two low-fat environments of FFM and SFM shared a higher degree of similarity while very different from their corresponding matrix, with some lipid species adsorbed with high enrichment factors, indicating specific interaction with the TiO2 surface outperforming lipid matrix concentration in determination of corona formation. Formation of the biocorona may have contributed to the reduced oxidative stress as well as toxicological impacts observed in cellular studies. The present work is the first to confirm persistent adsorption of biomolecules could occur on ingested nanomaterials in food digestae. More future studies are needed to study the in vivo impacts of the biocorona, and shed light on how the biocorona affects the biotransformations and fate of the ingested nanomaterials, which may impose impacts on human health."
"Nanopharmaceuticals for eye administration: Sterilization, depyrogenation and clinical applications","As an immune-privileged target organ, the eyes have important superficial and internal barriers, protecting them from physical and chemical damage from exogenous and/or endogenous origins that would cause injury to visual acuity or even vision loss. These anatomic, physiological and histologic barriers are thus a challenge for drug access and entry into the eye. Novel therapeutic concepts are highly desirable for eye treatment. The design of an efficient ocular drug delivery system still remains a challenge. Although nanotechnology may offer the ability to detect and treat eye diseases, successful treatment approaches are still in demand. The growing interest in nanopharmaceuticals offers the opportunity to improve ophthalmic treatments. Besides their size, which needs to be critically monitored, nanopharmaceuticals for ophthalmic applications have to be produced under sterilized conditions. In this work, we have revised the different sterilization and depyrogenation methods for ophthalmic nanopharmaceuticals with their merits and drawbacks. The paper also describes clinical sterilization of drugs and the outcomes of inappropriate practices, while recent applications of nanopharmaceuticals for ocular drug delivery are also addressed."
A semi-automated workflow for fair maturity indicators in the life sciences,"Data sharing and reuse are crucial to enhance scientific progress and maximize return of investments in science. Although attitudes are increasingly favorable, data reuse remains difficult due to lack of infrastructures, standards, and policies. The FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles aim to provide recommendations to increase data reuse. Because of the broad interpretation of the FAIR principles, maturity indicators are necessary to determine the FAIRness of a dataset. In this work, we propose a reproducible computational workflow to assess data FAIRness in the life sciences. Our implementation follows principles and guidelines recommended by the maturity indicator authoring group and integrates concepts from the literature. In addition, we propose a FAIR balloon plot to summarize and compare dataset FAIRness. We evaluated the feasibility of our method on three real use cases where researchers looked for six datasets to answer their scientific questions. We retrieved information from repositories (ArrayExpress, Gene Expression Omnibus, eNanoMapper, caNanoLab, NanoCommons and ChEMBL), a registry of repositories, and a searchable resource (Google Dataset Search) via application program interfaces (API) wherever possible. With our analysis, we found that the six datasets met the majority of the criteria defined by the maturity indicators, and we showed areas where improvements can easily be reached. We suggest that use of standard schema for metadata and the presence of specific attributes in registries of repositories could increase FAIRness of datasets."
Preparation of solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers for drug delivery and the effects of preparation parameters of solvent injection method,"Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) have emerged as potential drug delivery systems for various applications that are produced from physiological, biodegradable, and biocompatible lipids. The methods used to produce SLNs and NLCs have been well investigated and reviewed, but solvent injection method provides an alternative means of preparing these drug carriers. The advantages of solvent injection method include a fast production process, easiness of handling, and applicability in many laboratories without requirement of complicated instruments. The effects of formulations and process parameters of this method on the characteristics of the produced SLNs and NLCs have been investigated in several studies. This review describes the methods currently used to prepare SLNs and NLCs with focus on solvent injection method. We summarize recent development in SLNs and NLCs production using this technique. In addition, the effects of solvent injection process parameters on SLNs and NLCs characteristics are discussed."
The presence of fine and ultrafine particulate matter in the work environment,"This study presents the results of pilot measurement, where the exposure of fine and ultrafine particulate matter was monitored. The measurement was performed in welding workplace, where these particles are produced unintentionally. The measurement consisted of collecting information and measuring the concentration of particles in the workplace, where data collection was focused only on inhalation exposure. During welding, primarily 300 nm size particles are produced, and their concentration is strongly influenced by the welding material, type of welding and suction. The particles are amorphous in terms of morphology and contain manganese, iron and silicon, which can cause neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the results indicate the importance of monitoring oral exposure."
Release mechanisms for PA6 nanocomposites under weathering conditions simulating their outdoor uses,"The increased use of polymer nanocomposites in different applications could lead to potential nanofiller release into different human and environmental compartments and consequently, increase the exposure of human and environmental species to nanomaterials. This study aims at determining how the inclusion of nanofillers with diverse chemical nature (SiO2, TiO2, ZnO, multiwalled carbon nanotubes and two nano-organoclays) in polyamide 6 composites influences the nanomaterial release during the use of these products. The different nanocomposites were exposed to accelerated ageing processes, simulating outdoor conditions, through irradiation with UV light under a combination of dry-wet cycles. Release monitoring consisted of nanocomposites characterisation, run-off waters collection and released materials quantification and characterisation. The study confirmed that the chemical surface nature of the nanofiller strongly impacts on polymer degradation, in some cases enhancing its protection and in others promoting polyamide hydrolysis and/or photo-degradation processes. Polymer degradation and nanomaterial-polymer compatibility are the main determinants for the release and consequent exposure to nanofillers."

Predicting cytotoxicity of metal oxide nanoparticles using isalos analytics platform,"A literature curated dataset containing 24 distinct metal oxide (MexOy) nanoparticles (NPs), including 15 physicochemical, structural and assay-related descriptors, was enriched with 62 atomistic computational descriptors and exploited to produce a robust and validated in silico model for prediction of NP cytotoxicity. The model can be used to predict the cytotoxicity (cell viability) of MexOy NPs based on the colorimetric lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and the luminometric adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assay, both of which quantify irreversible cell membrane damage. Out of the 77 total descriptors used, 7 were identified as being significant for induction of cytotoxicity by MexOy NPs. These were NP core size, hydrodynamic size, assay type, exposure dose, the energy of the MexOy conduction band (EC), the coordination number of the metal atoms on the NP surface (Avg. C.N. Me atoms surface) and the average force vector surface normal component of all metal atoms (v⊥ Me atoms surface). The significance and effect of these descriptors is discussed to demonstrate their direct correlation with cytotoxicity. The produced model has been made publicly available by the Horizon 2020 (H2020) NanoSolveIT project and will be added to the project’s Integrated Approach to Testing and Assessment (IATA)."

Hepatic impacts of gold nanoparticles with different surface coatings as revealed by assessing the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme and lipid homeostasis in mice,"Liver is the major organ in the metabolization of drugs, and detoxification of exogenous substances, including nanoparticles. In clinical medical practice, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the major cause of acute liver failure (ALF). In this study, we explore the possible impact of intravenously injected citrate acid (CA), chitosan (CS) and polyethyleneglycol (PEG) functionalized gold nanoparticles (GNPs) on the liver of mice at the doses (60 and 120 μg/mouse) relevant to their biomedical applications. Overall, the results provide the evidence that all the GNPs did not induce obvious liver injury and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the study highlights that alteration in the function of drug-metabolizing enzymes in the HepaRG cells was associated with the increase cytotoxicity of GNP treatments. Moreover, the deposited GNPs in the liver disturb the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes, including drug uptake and efflux transporters, and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoforms and phase II metabolized enzymes. The mechanism of GNP-induced hepatotoxicity in mice is associated with hyperactivation of mTOR signalling and SREBP-1c-mediated de novo lipogenesis with hepatic inflammation. This also suggests that when using GNPs for biomedical applications, it is necessary to consider the influence of nanomaterial-liver interaction and nanomaterial-induced hepatotoxicity on drug-metabolizing enzymes and lipid homeostasis."
Beclin 2 negatively regulates innate immune signaling and tumor development,"Beclin 2 plays a critical role in metabolic regulation and obesity, but its functions in innate immune signaling and cancer development remain largely unknown. Here, we identified Beclin 2 as a critical negative regulator of inflammation and lymphoma development. Mice with homozygous ablation of BCL2-interacting protein 2 (Becn2) developed splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy and markedly increased ERK1/2 and NF-κB signaling for proinflammatory cytokine production. Beclin 2 targeted the key signaling kinases MEKK3 and TAK1 for degradation through an ATG9A-dependent, but ATG16L/ Beclin 1/LC3-independent, autophagic pathway. Mechanistically, Beclin 2 recruited MEKK3 or TAK1 through ATG9A to form a complex (Beclin 2-ATG9A-MEKK3) on ATG9A+ vesicles upon ULK1 activation. Beclin 2 further interacted with STX5 and STX6 to promote the fusion of MEKK3- or TAK1-associated ATG9A+ vesicles to phagophores for subsequent degradation. Importantly, Becn2-deficient mice had a markedly increased incidence of lymphoma development, with persistent STAT3 activation. Myeloid-specific ablation of MEKK3 (Map3k3) completely rescued the phenotypes (splenomegaly, higher amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, and cancer incidence) of Becn2-deficient mice. Hence, our findings have identified an important role of Beclin 2 in the negative regulation of innate immune signaling and tumor development through an ATG9Adependent, but ATG16L/Beclin 1/LC3-independent, autophagic pathway, thus providing a potential target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancer."
Smart nanocarriers for cancer treatment: Clinical impact and safety,"Cancer, as a global health issue, its treatment with conventional approaches is challenged by non-specific biodistribution and targeting, poor solubility, low therapeutic indices and majorly the development of multi-drug resistance (MDR) that enables the cancer cells to survive against antineoplastic agents. A better understanding in tumor biology as well as a huge progression in nanotechnology in recent years have led to the interest in developing nanoscale carriers capable of delivering drugs appropriately to specific tumor sites. With the advanced surface modification techniques, nanoparticles decorated with different surfactants/polymer coatings/ligands have shown their abilities much more superior to conventional cancer treatments. Specifically, they are featured with properties such as specific targeting, water soluble, stable, biocompatible and biodegradable, while certain type has demonstrated the ability to reverse MDR effect. This review consolidates the limitations of current nanocarriers as well as the development of several smart nanocarriers, namely liposomes, dendrimers, carbon nanotubes and polymeric micelles. We also discuss the future research prospects and potential improvements in these smart nanocarriers."
Perspective on a risk-based roadmap towards the implementation of the safe innovation approach for industry,"The challenge in ensuring the safety of manufactured nanomaterials and products stems from the lack of knowledge among industries about the potential environment and health risks of nanotechnology based innovations and the legislations that apply to them. A lack of information and preparedness for the regulatory safety assessment of innovative nanomaterials and products often lead to their delay in market launch or complete abandoning. Safe Innovation Approach (SIA) is a proactive system that aims to minimize the gap between the pace of innovation and the pace of developing nano-specific risk governance. The use of SIA framework in product innovation value chain can ensure sustainable innovative products and rapid market launch for which relevant regulatory framework is in place through a proactive collaboration of all concerned stakeholders. Previous efforts within several European projects and other national collaborations have helped to continue developing a framework for SIA, operationalizing the required infrastructure for its implementation, and developing novel innovation and governance processes for industry and regulators respectively to practice it. In line with these developments, the present work provides a perspective of a risk-based roadmap to be integrated in the current state of the SIA framework. Recommendations to further improve certain aspects of SIA innovation process are provided in this context, and a risk-aware integrated roadmap is presented on the basis of these recommendations to assist the industry to adopt SIA as a regular industrial practice. This can sustainably improve the margin of industrial profit from manufacturing and processing of nanomaterials and products with compliant environmental and human health safety features throughout their life cycle."
Recent advances of morphology adaptive nanomaterials for anti-cancer drug delivery,"The morphology of nanomaterials combines the characteristics of their size, shape and spatial structure. Owing to the improved spatiotemporal control of the nanocarriers for anti-cancer drug delivery, the morphology adaptive nanomaterials have received tremendous attention in the field of nanomedicine, while they are able to respond through chemical or physical change. In this review, we summarize the recent advancements of morphology adaptive nanomaterials and their application in anti-cancer drug delivery system, wherein the size, shape and spatial structure of nanocarriers can be changed to adapt the complex living system, thus overcoming the pathological barriers in drug delivery. The overview of the recent examples shows that each step of delivery process can be improved by the morphology adaption, which represents the great potential for clinic translation of morphology adaptive nanomaterials."
Susceptibility factors in chronic lung inflammatory responses to engineered nanomaterials,"Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are products of the emerging nanotechnology industry and many different types of ENMs have been shown to cause chronic inflammation in the lungs of rodents after inhalation exposure, suggesting a risk to human health. Due to the increasing demand and use of ENMs in a variety of products, a careful evaluation of the risks to human health is urgently needed. An assessment of the immunotoxicity of ENMs should consider susceptibility factors including sex, pre-existing diseases, deficiency of specific genes encoding proteins involved in the innate or adaptive immune response, and co-exposures to other chemicals. This review will address evidence from experimental animal models that highlights some important issues of susceptibility to chronic lung inflammation and systemic immune dysfunction after pulmonary exposure to ENMs."
Vertically aligned carbon nanotube membranes: Water purification and beyond,"Vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) membranes have attracted significant attention for water purification owing to their ultra-high water permeability and antibacterial properties. In this paper, we critically review the recent progresses in the synthesis of VACNT arrays and fabrication of VACNT membrane methods, with particular emphasis on improving water permeability and anti-biofouling properties. Furthermore, potential applications of VACNT membranes other than water purification (e.g., conductive membranes, electrodes in proton exchange membrane fuel cells, and solar electricity–water generators) have been introduced. Finally, future outlooks are provided to overcome the limitations of commercialization and desalination currently faced by VACNT membranes. This review will be useful to researchers in the broader scientific community as it discusses current and new trends regarding the development of VACNT membranes as well as their potential applications."
"The Chemistry of Reticular Framework Nanoparticles: MOF, ZIF, and COF Materials","Nanoparticles have become a vital part of a vast number of established processes and products; they are used as catalysts, in cosmetics, and even by the pharmaceutical industry. Despite this, however, the reliable and reproducible production of functional nanoparticles for specific applications remains a great challenge. In this respect, reticular chemistry provides methods for connecting molecular building blocks to nanoparticles whose chemical composition, structure, porosity, and functionality can be controlled and tuned with atomic precision. Thus, reticular chemistry allows for the translation of the green chemistry principle of atom economy to functional nanomaterials, giving rise to the multifunctional efficiency concept. This principle encourages the design of highly active nanomaterials by maximizing the number of integrated functional units while minimizing the number of inactive components. State-of-the-art research on reticular nanoparticles—metal-organic frameworks, zeolitic imidazolate frameworks, and covalent organic frameworks—is critically assessed and the beneficial features and particular challenges that set reticular chemistry apart from other nanoparticle material classes are highlighted. Reviewing the power of reticular chemistry, it is suggested that the unique possibility to efficiently and straightforwardly synthesize multifunctional nanoparticles should guide the synthesis of customized nanoparticles in the future."
Effect of the albumin corona on the toxicity of combined graphene oxide and cadmium to daphnia magna and integration of the datasets into the nanocommons knowledge base,"In this work, we evaluated the effect of protein corona formation on graphene oxide (GO) mixture toxicity testing (i.e., co-exposure) using the Daphnia magna model and assessing acute toxicity determined as immobilisation. Cadmium (Cd2+ ) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were selected as co-pollutant and protein model system, respectively. Albumin corona formation on GO dramatically increased its colloidal stability (ca. 60%) and Cd2+ adsorption capacity (ca. 4.5 times) in reconstituted water (Daphnia medium). The acute toxicity values (48 h-EC50 ) observed were 0.18 mg L−1 for Cd2+-only and 0.29 and 0.61 mg L−1 following co-exposure of Cd2+ with GO and BSA@GO materials, respectively, at a fixed non-toxic concentration of 1.0 mg L−1 . After coronation of GO with BSA, a reduction in cadmium toxicity of 110 % and 238% was achieved when compared to bare GO and Cd2+-only, respectively. Integration of datasets associated with graphene-based materials, heavy metals and mixture toxicity is essential to enable re-use of the data and facilitate nanoinformatics approaches for design of safer nanomaterials for water quality monitoring and remediation technologies. Hence, all data from this work were annotated and integrated into the NanoCommons Knowledge Base, connecting the experimental data to nanoinformatics platforms under the FAIR data principles and making them interoperable with similar datasets."
Your spreadsheets can be fair: A tool and fairification workflow for the enanomapper database,"The field of nanoinformatics is rapidly developing and provides data driven solutions in the area of nanomaterials (NM) safety. Safe by Design approaches are encouraged and promoted through regulatory initiatives and multiple scientific projects. Experimental data is at the core of nanoinformatics processing workflows for risk assessment. The nanosafety data is predominantly recorded in Excel spreadsheet files. Although the spreadsheets are quite convenient for the experimentalists, they also pose great challenges for the consequent processing into databases due to variability of the templates used, specific details provided by each laboratory and the need for proper metadata documentation and formatting. In this paper, we present a workflow to facilitate the conversion of spreadsheets into a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) database, with the pivotal aid of the NMDataParser tool, developed to streamline the mapping of the original file layout into the eNanoMapper semantic data model. The NMDataParser is an open source Java library and application, making use of a JSON configuration to define the mapping. We describe the JSON configuration syntax and the approaches applied for parsing different spreadsheet layouts used by the nanosafety community. Examples of using the NMDataParser tool in nanoinformatics workflows are given. Challenging cases are discussed and appropriate solutions are proposed."
The importance of evaluating the lot-to-lot batch consistency of commercial multi-walled carbon nanotube products,"The biological response of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) is related to their physicochemical properties and a thorough MWNT characterization should accompany an assessment of their biological activity, including their potential toxicity. Beyond characterizing the physicochemical properties of MWNTs from different sources or manufacturers, it is also important to characterize different production lots of the same MWNT product from the same vendor (i.e., lot-to-lot batch consistency). Herein, we present a comprehensive physicochemical characterization of two lots of commercial pristine MWNTs (pMWNTs) and carboxylated MWNTs (cMWNTs) used to study the response of mammalian macrophages to MWNTs. There were many similarities between the physicochemical properties of the two lots of cMWNTs and neither significantly diminished the 24-h proliferation of RAW 264.7 macrophages up to the highest concentration tested (200 µg cMWNTs/mL). Conversely, several physicochemical properties of the two lots of pMWNTs were different; notably, the newer lot of pMWNTs displayed less oxidative stability, a higher defect density, and a smaller amount of surface oxygen species relative to the original lot. Furthermore, a 72-h half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC-50) of ~90 µg pMWNTs/mL was determined for RAW 264.7 cells with the new lot of pMWNTs. These results demonstrate that subtle physicochemical differences can lead to significantly dissimilar cellular responses, and that production-lot consistency must be considered when assessing the toxicity of MWNTs."
Cellular and molecular mechanisms of environmental pollutants on hematopoiesis,"Hematopoiesis is a complex and intricate process that aims to replenish blood components in a constant fashion. It is orchestrated mostly by hematopoietic progenitor cells (hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)) that are capable of self-renewal and differentiation. These cells can originate other cell subtypes that are responsible for maintaining vital functions, mediate innate and adaptive immune responses, provide tissues with oxygen, and control coagulation. Hematopoiesis in adults takes place in the bone marrow, which is endowed with an extensive vasculature conferring an intense flow of cells. A myriad of cell subtypes can be found in the bone marrow at different levels of activation, being also under constant action of an extensive amount of diverse chemical mediators and enzymatic systems. Bone marrow platelets, mature erythrocytes and leukocytes are delivered into the bloodstream readily available to meet body demands. Leukocytes circulate and reach different tissues, returning or not returning to the bloodstream. Senescent leukocytes, specially granulocytes, return to the bone marrow to be phagocytized by macrophages, restarting granulopoiesis. The constant high production and delivery of cells into the bloodstream, alongside the fact that blood cells can also circulate between tissues, makes the hematopoietic system a prime target for toxic agents to act upon, making the understanding of the bone marrow microenvironment vital for both toxicological sciences and risk assessment. Environmental and occupational pollutants, therapeutic molecules, drugs of abuse, and even nutritional status can directly affect progenitor cells at their differentiation and maturation stages, altering behavior and function of blood compounds and resulting in impaired immune responses, anemias, leukemias, and blood coagulation disturbances. This review aims to describe the most recently investigated molecular and cellular toxicity mechanisms of current major environmental pollutants on hematopoiesis in the bone marrow."
Fighting against Drug-Resistant Tumors using a Dual-Responsive Pt(IV)/Ru(II) Bimetallic Polymer,"Drug resistance is a major problem in cancer treatment. Herein, the design of a dual-responsive Pt(IV)/Ru(II) bimetallic polymer (PolyPt/Ru) to treat cisplatin-resistant tumors in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model is reported. PolyPt/Ru is an amphiphilic ABA-type triblock copolymer. The hydrophilic A blocks consist of biocompatible poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). The hydrophobic B block contains reduction-responsive Pt(IV) and red-light-responsive Ru(II) moieties. PolyPt/Ru self-assembles into nanoparticles that are efficiently taken up by cisplatin-resistant cancer cells. Irradiation of cancer cells containing PolyPt/Ru nanoparticles with red light generates 1O2, induces polymer degradation, and triggers the release of the Ru(II) anticancer agent. Meanwhile, the anticancer drug, cisplatin, is released in the intracellular environment via reduction of the Pt(IV) moieties. The released Ru(II) anticancer agent, cisplatin, and the generated 1O2 have different anticancer mechanisms; their synergistic effects inhibit the growth of drug-resistant cancer cells. Furthermore, PolyPt/Ru nanoparticles inhibit tumor growth in a PDX mouse model because they circulate in the bloodstream, accumulate at tumor sites, exhibit good biocompatibility, and do not cause side effects. The results demonstrate that the development of stimuli-responsive multi-metallic polymers provides a new strategy to overcome drug resistance."
The necessity of investigating a freshwater-marine continuum using a mesocosm approach in nanosafety: The case study of TiO<inf>2</inf> MNM-based photocatalytic cement,"Production of Manufactured Nanomaterials (MNMs) has increased extensively due to economic interest in the current years. However, this widespread use raises concern about their impact on human and environment. Current efforts are made, both at national and international levels to help developing safer MNMs in the market. In order to assess hazards of MNMs, it is important to take into account exposome parameters in order to link fate and behavior of MNMs to their potential toxicity. In that context, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of TiO2 MNMs-based cement at different levels of its life cycle (TiO2MNMs, cement containing TiO2 MNMs) on two exposure mesocosm scenarios mimicking: marine conditions using the bivalve Scrobicularia plana and freshwater conditions using the gastropod Planorbarius corneus for 28 days, allowing measurements of physical-chemical parameters throughout the duration of the exposure. Similar results were observed in both exposure conditions since in the two scenarios Ti was removed from the water column and accumulated in surficial sediments. While in P. corneus, statistically different concentrations of Ti were measured in the digestive glands compared to controls following exposure to TiO2 MNMs, elevated background of Ti concentrations were measured in the controls of S. plana that did not allow to discriminating any bioaccumulation process. In addition, both TiO2 MNMs and TiO2MNM-based cement exposed S. plana did not present any activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs). This study demonstrates the robustness of using both freshwater and marine mesocosms for evaluation of risk associated with nanomaterial."
Dielectric parameters of activated carbon derived from rosewood and corncob,"To make use of two waste natural corncob and rosewood, activated carbons are obtained through KOH activation at 1073 K. The two samples show sheet like morphology with some swells on the surface of the corncob activated carbon and pores in the rosewood activated carbon. The higher ID/IG value of rosewood activated carbon for the Raman spectrum measurement indicates its lower graphitization degree than corncob activated carbon, which is proved by X-ray diffraction patterns. The higher real and imaginary parts of the complex permittivity for the rosewood activated carbon are benefited from the differences of morphology and graphitization degree of the two samples. Apart from the dipole polarization, the charge polarization and interfacial polarization also contribute to the dielectric loss for the porous rosewood activated carbon."
Transformable Dual-Inhibition System Effectively Suppresses Renal Cancer Metastasis through Blocking Endothelial Cells and Cancer Stem Cells,"Tumor vasculature and cancer stem cells (CSCs) accelerate the development of metastatic renal cancer. Dual inhibition of vascular endothelium and CSCs is still a challenge due to their different pathological features. Herein, a transformable dual-inhibition system (TDS) based on a self-assembly peptide is proposed to construct nanofibrous barriers on the cell membrane in situ, which contributes to 1) reducing endothelial permeability and angiogenesis; and 2) inhibiting stemness and metastasis of CSCs in renal cancer. TDS specifically targets overexpressed receptor CD105 that provides the possibility to modulate both endothelial cells and CSCs for cancer therapy. Subsequently, owing to ligand—receptor interaction-induced transformation, the nanofibers form a barrier on the cell membrane. For vascular endothelium, TDS reduces the vascular permeability to 67.0% ± 4.7% and decreases angiogenesis to 62.0% ± 4.0%, thereby preventing the renal cancer metastasis. For human-derived CSCs, TDS inhibits stemness by reducing endogenic miR-19b and its transportation via CSCs-derived exosomes, which increases PTEN expression and consequently suppresses CSCs-mediated metastasis. In patient-derived xenograft mice, TDS significantly inhibits the tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. It also reduces the metastatic nodules in lung 5.0-fold compared with the control group. TDS opens up a promising avenue for suppressing the metastasis of cancer."
"Progress and Upcoming Challenges of Nano-Safety: Education, Manufacture, and Long-Term Impacts","It has been more than 10 years since the concept of nanotechnology safety (nano-safety) was first proposed and detailed by the Texas State University Nanomaterials Application Center director. The concept of nano-safety has developed in educational efforts that have increased the awareness and competence of graduating students. Much dissemination along multiple paths still needs to be done. This dissemination includes education of incumbent workers as well as students. This article provides a short overview of the need for training in nanosafety followed by a section on the initial efforts to educate students and employees in the safe handling and use of nanomaterials. The challenge that remains is how to address the potential impact of the rapid development of new materials in the field of nanotechnology. Finally, some needed investigations are presented."
Nanotechnological interventions for the treatment of renal diseases: Current scenario and future prospects,"Nanotechnology is one of the emerging field and an important tool for the diagnosis and cure of several diseases. Nanomaterials (NMs), with unique targeting specificities, have already generated a significant amount of interests amongst biomedical researchers. The ease of doing surface functionalization along with convenient encapsulation methodologies for bioactive, make NMs a perfect candidate for drug delivery applications. Kidney diseases are a major health problem throughout the world with more prevalence in developing countries. The major ailments include acute renal injury, chronic kidney disease, renal cancer and end-stage renal disease, having multiple etiologies related to sequential pathophysiological stages. In the past few years, many studies of NMs mainly focused on cancer targeting have accidentally resulted in significant findings related to selective kidney targeting and renal accumulation. Nanotechnological interventions improved drug bioavailability and enabled targeted delivery of drugs to specific tissues, cells, or subcellular compartments. Similarly, NMs based diagnostics with point-of-care solutions have provided early recognition of the specific disease sites with higher resolution and lower limit of detection of the targeted biological analyte. Even after the exponential increase in the funds of nanomedicine research worldwide, reports for treating kidney disorders using NMs, are rather scarce in literature with almost no clinically approved nanoparticles (NPs) available in the market that specifically target the kidney for therapeutic or imaging applications. This paper will review the application of NMs for the treatment of renal diseases and their future prospects."
Continuous efforts to understand the environmental health and safety (EHS) of nanomaterials for safer applications,
Micelleplex-based nucleic acid therapeutics: From targeted stimuli-responsiveness to nanotoxicity and regulation,"Cell-targeted nucleic acid (NA) therapeutics, either DNA- or RNA-based, have experienced considerable attention regarding their potential applications in gene expression modulation aiming at disease management. However, the therapeutic potential of NAs as selective, safe and multispecific biomolecules is principally hindered by their instability in biological fluids and deficient cellular uptake, urgently calling for intelligent design strategies such as NA loading in effective nanosystems. In this regard, NA delivery nanosystems which bypass biological hurdles and are capable of safeguarding the NA payload have been extensively explored so far. Micelleplexes consist of tailored and multifunctional micelle-like nanoassemblies of negatively-charged NAs complexed with cationic blocks, generally of polymeric nature, this way ensuring efficient NA protection and transportation, as well as enhanced cellular transfection and boosted intracellular trafficking. Herein, we review the biomedical applications of stable micelleplexes as robust and smart NA delivery nanosystems focusing on the fine-tuning of their properties toward stimuli-responsiveness and the nanosystem's versatility to accommodate distinct ligands for selective tissue-targeting purposes. Additionally, the nanosafety and regulatory considerations of micelleplexes will also be discussed toward the future clinical translation of micelleplexes for efficient NA delivery to cells, paving the way to next-generation micelleplex-based NA therapeutics."
NiS nanoparticles assembled on biological cell walls-derived porous hollow carbon spheres as a novel battery-type electrode for hybrid supercapacitor,"Abstract: Designing a battery-type electrode material with high electrochemical performance based on eco-friendly and sustainable strategy has great significance for the development of supercapacitors. Herein, NiS nanoparticles are deposited on the surface of the porous hollow carbon spheres (PHCSs) derived from inexpensive and pollution-free yeast cells wall by an in situ hydrothermal process, forming a litchi shell-like three-dimensional (3D) double-shell structure. The PHCSs as a carbon substrate can effectively suppress the aggregation of NiS nanoparticles and ensure more ground storage sites to enhance the performance of the electrode material. More notably, the reaction concentration of nickel ion has a remarkable effect on the electrochemical performance of composites. The optimized sample shows a high specific capacity of 531.5 C g−1 at 1 A g−1, excellent rate capability of 412.1 C g−1 at 10 A g−1 and outstanding cycling life span of 83.3% after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, the assembled hybrid device delivers a high energy density of 24.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 767 W kg−1 and an excellent cycle stability by delivering 89.3% capacitance retention after 5000 ultralong cycles. This work offers a feasible strategy to synthesize economical and efficient electrode materials and demonstrates its enormous potential in energy storage. Graphic abstract: A novel NiS/porous hollow carbon sphere composite with double-shell structure was synthesized by a green and available self-template method, which exhibits superior supercapacitor performance.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
Metadata stewardship in nanosafety research: Community-driven organisation of metadata schemas to support fair nanoscience data,"The emergence of nanoinformatics as a key component of nanotechnology and nanosafety assessment for the prediction of engineered nanomaterials (NMs) properties, interactions, and hazards, and for grouping and read-across to reduce reliance on animal testing, has put the spotlight firmly on the need for access to high-quality, curated datasets. To date, the focus has been around what constitutes data quality and completeness, on the development of minimum reporting standards, and on the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data principles. However, moving from the theoretical realm to practical implementation requires human intervention, which will be facilitated by the definition of clear roles and responsibilities across the complete data lifecycle and a deeper appreciation of what metadata is, and how to capture and index it. Here, we demonstrate, using specific worked case studies, how to organise the nano-community efforts to define metadata schemas, by organising the data management cycle as a joint effort of all players (data creators, analysts, curators, managers, and customers) supervised by the newly defined role of data shepherd. We propose that once researchers understand their tasks and responsibilities, they will naturally apply the available tools. Two case studies are presented (modelling of particle agglomeration for dose metrics, and consensus for NM dissolution), along with a survey of the currently implemented metadata schema in existing nanosafety databases. We conclude by offering recommendations on the steps forward and the needed workflows for metadata capture to ensure FAIR nanosafety data."
"Effects of multiwalled carbon nanotubes co-exposure with cadmium on zebrafish cell line: Metal uptake and accumulation, oxidative stress, genotoxicity and cell cycle","Carbon nanotubes presence in the environment increases every year because of exponential industrial production around the world. In aquatic environments, carbon nanotubes can interact with other pollutants based on their adsorbent surface chemistry properties. Heavy metal ions represent one of the biggest concerns in water resources nowadays due to anthropogenic activities, in which cadmium (Cd) is one of the most harmful metal for aquatic organisms. This study investigated the influence of two co-exposure protocols differing by the order of interaction of oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (ox-MWCNT) with Cd in zebrafish liver cell line (ZFL). The ox-MWCNT was characterized, Cd content in culture medium and uptake by cells were quantified using ICP-MS and, the reactive oxygen species (ROS), the biotransformation enzymes activity of phase I and II as well as the antioxidants defenses and oxidative damage were analyzed. The effects on the cell cycle were investigated by flow cytometry and DNA damage by comet assay. The exposure to ox-MWCNT alone decreased the activity of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase and altered the cell cycle with a reduction of cells in the G2/M phase. Cd exposure alone decreased the activity of catalase and glutathione S-transferase, increased ROS, metallothionein, and lipid peroxidation content and causes genotoxicity in the cells. Despite different incubation protocol, the co-exposure ox-MWCNT-Cd increased the Cd content in ZFL cells after 24 h exposure, increased ROS production and DNA damage without differences between them. Our results showed the modulation of ox-MWCNT on Cd effects and contributed to future co-exposure toxicity investigations and nanosafety regulations involving carbon nanomaterials and aquatic pollutants."
Superhydrophilic fluorinated polymer and nanogel for high-performance <sup>19</sup>F magnetic resonance imaging,"19F magnetic resonance imaging (19F MRI), a kind of non-invasive and non-radioactive diagnostic technique with no endogenous background signals, opens up new research avenues for accurate molecular imaging studies. However, 19F MRI is manily limited by the performance of contrast agents. Here, for the first time, we presented the zwitterionic fluorinated polymer and nanogel as new types of superhydrophilic, sensitive and ultra-stable 19F MRI contrast agents. The superhydrophilicity of carboxybetaine zwitterionic structure completely overcame the hydrophobic aggregation-induced signal attenuation associated with amphiphilic fluorinated polymer-based nanoprobes. In addition, the superhydrophilic contrast agent exhibited distinct advantages, including high 19F-content (19.1 wt%), superior resistance to protein adsorption, constant MR properties and 19F MRS-based quantitative determination in complex biological fluids, and intense 19F MRI signals in the whole-body images after intravenous injection. In combination with angiogenesis targeting ligand, the superhydrophilic contrast agent was applied for the unambiguous detection of tumor. Importantly, computational algorithm was established for the directly quantitative determination of bioavailability and tumor-to-whole body ratio (TBR) from the in vivo 19F MRI dataset, providing real-time information with non-invasive manner. Finally, crosslinked nanogels were developed with significantly prolonged systemic circulation, of which intense 19F MRI signals nonspecifically distributed in the aortaventralis and blood-rich organs, instead of being trapped steadily in liver as with the state-of-the-art superhydrophobic perfluocarbon nanoemulsions. Overall, this kind of superhydrophilic, zwitterionic fluorinated polymer and nanogel could be defined as a new generation of high-performance 19F MRI contrast agents, which hold great potential for image-based unambiguous disease detection and computational quantification."
Graphdiyne-templated palladium-nanoparticle assembly as a robust oxygen generator to attenuate tumor hypoxia,"Nanocatalysts have attracted many concerns in biomedical fields because their catalytic performance is robust and remains efficient even at a harsh condition compared to biological enzymes. However, the stability for both physical forms and the catalytic activity are the main challenges during biomedical applications. Here, we described a strategy to prepare a stable nanocatalyst that two-dimensional (2D) graphdiyne (GDY) serves as a template to immobilize catalytic palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) on the GDY surface. In the presence of H2O2, the PdNPs/GDY composite functions as an oxygen generator to decompose H2O2 to produce molecular oxygen, which efficiently attenuates tumor hypoxia and delays tumor growth. According to X-ray absorption spectroscopy and computational simulation, we revealed that PdNPs mainly contribute to the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 companying with the variation in chemical forms of Pd in the presence of H2O2. Importantly, 2D GDY firmly anchors and disperses ultra-small PdNPs on the surface via Pd-C bonds to prevent the oxidation and aggregation of PdNPs that realizes sustainable and stable catalysis. This design endows the highly immobilized content of Pd on GDY, high catalytic activity and higher stability in catalytic reaction than commercial Pd/C and PdNPs/GO, accordingly. The PdNPs/GDY composite also exhibits as an effective and durable oxygen generator to decompose endogenous H2O2 and produces O2 inside solid tumors, attenuates tumor hypoxia, down-regulates HIF-1α expression and ultimately delays tumor growth in both human patient-derived squamous cell lung carcinoma xenograft model and 4T1 breast cancer xenografted mouse model. Moreover, in the combination with the chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin, PdNPs/GDY-based catalytic therapy achieved a significantly enhanced antitumor effect. Our findings demonstrate that the rational design of a nano-modulator for tumor hypoxia with long term stability is a promising way to enhance the outcome of tumor therapy."
Laser sintering of graphene nanoplatelets encapsulated polyamide powders,"This paper presents a comprehensive study in the fabrication and safety of new nanocomposite powders for laser sintering. The nanocomposite powder is based on a core-shell structure where nanoparticles (graphene nanoplatelets, GNP) are encapsulated on the surface of the polymeric particles (polyamides PA12) in a thin layer of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). Powder rheology data as well as SEM and TEM showed that GNP were dispersed well in the PVA coating and improved flow. Half time crystallisation kinetics was used to determine differences induced in the polymer and the laser sintering process by the presence of GNP. Nanosafety aspects, critical in a manufacturing environment, are also considered here and exposure monitoring tests were carried out. Results confirmed a low nanoparticle air exposure and therefore confirmed the successful surface encapsulation of the GNP in nanocomposite powders. The laser-sintered 0.1GNP/PVA-PA12 parts showed enhanced mechanical properties in tensile, compression and 3-point bending test."
Fabrication of water-resistance and durable antimicrobial adhesion polyurethane coating containing weakly amphiphilic poly(isobornyl acrylate) Side chains,"Polyurethane (PU) coatings are the most preferred systems in widespread applications on account of their great variability and fine-tuning of material properties. In this work, we have developed an eco-friendly antimicrobial polyurethane with natural-sourced isobornyl antifoulant side chains. A key development is the preparation of weakly amphiphilic poly(isobornyl acrylate) (PIBA) with terminal dihydroxy by thiol-ene ‘click’ reaction under UV catalysis. Then, the macro-polyol rich in isobornyl group is incorporated as a chain extender to achieve the functionalized polyurethane resin (PIBA-PU). Our study shows that the introduction of PIBA pendant long chains slightly affects the thermal behaviors of the soft and hard segments of PIBA-PU, and significantly improves the water-resistance of polyurethane coating as expected. The antibacterial and antifungal adhesion performances of the coatings are both substantially enhanced at higher content of PIBA. Leather-finishing application further indicates that PIBA-PU coated leather surfaces exhibit effective and long-lasting antifungal activity. The results suggest that functionalizing polyurethane with weakly amphiphilic acrylate long chains offers novel options for green coating design, whereby surface hydrophobicity and antimicrobial performances are both satisfactory and suitable for surface finishing."
A smart DNA nanodevice for ATP-activatable bioimaging and photodynamic therapy,"Rational design of activatable photosensitizers for controlled generation of singlet oxygen remains a challenge for precise photodynamic therapy (PDT). Herein, we present an aptamer-based nanodevice for adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)-activatable bioimaging and PDT. The nanodevice is constructed by modifying ATP-responsive duplex DNA units and polyethylene glycol on the surface of a gold nanoparticle (AuNP) through the thiolate-Au chemistry. The DNA units were designed by the hybridization of the ATP aptamer strand with a methylene blue (MB)-modified complementary DNA (cDNA). The close proximity of MB to the surface of AuNP results in the low photodynamic activity of MB (OFF state). Once internalized into cancer cells, the ATP-binding induced conformation switch of aptamer strand leads to the release of the MB-bearing DNA strand from AuNPs, resulting in the activatable generation of singlet oxygen under light irradiation (ON state). We demonstrate that the DNA nanodevice represents a promising platform for ATP-responsive bioimaging and specific PDT in vitro and in vivo. This work highlights a potential way for specific tumor diagnosis and therapy.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."

Imaging and monitoring HER2 expression in breast cancer during trastuzumab therapy with a peptide probe <sup>99m</sup>Tc-HYNIC-H10F,"Purpose: The novel molecular imaging probe 99mTc-HYNIC-H10F was developed for patient screening and efficacy monitoring of trastuzumab therapy by SPECT imaging of HER2 expression in breast cancer. Methods: 99mTc-HYNIC-H10F was developed by labeling H10F peptide with 99mTc following an optimized protocol. Biodistribution and SPECT/CT were performed in mouse models bearing HER2-positive SK-BR3 and HER2-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer xenografts, respectively. The treatment response to trastuzumab was monitored and quantified by SPECT/CT in two HER2-positive breast cancer models (SK-BR3 and MDA-MB-361). The preliminary clinical study was performed in two patients with breast cancer. Results: SPECT/CT with 99mTc-HYNIC-H10F showed that the SK-BR3 tumors were clearly visualized, while the signals from MDA-MB-231 tumors were much lower. The tumor uptake of 99mTc-HYNIC-H10F could be blocked by excess unlabeled H10F peptide but not by excess trastuzumab. The growth of two HER2-positive tumors was prominently suppressed at day 11 post-treatment. However, SPECT/CT reflected much earlier therapy response at day 4 post-treatment. The HER2 expression in tumors of breast cancer patients could be detected by 99mTc-HYNIC-H10F SPECT/CT imaging. Conclusions: 99mTc-HYNIC-H10F specifically accumulates in HER2-positive tumors. Compared with trastuzumab, 99mTc-HYNIC-H10F binds to a different domain of HER2 antigen, providing new opportunities to monitor HER2 expression levels before/during/after trastuzumab treatment for more effective personalized treatment."
A ratiometric photoacoustic imaging approach for semi-quantitative determination of aggregation efficiency: In vivo,"In vivo self-assembly not only endows dynamic supramolecules with various biological functions, but also realizes metabolic differences, and improves the level of diagnosis and treatment. However, the method of measuring aggregation efficiency in vivo is still challenging. In this work, we first proposed a ratiometric photoacoustic imaging method to measure the aggregation efficiency of molecules in vivo in real time and semi-quantitatively. Similar to the traditional fluorescence method, the ratiometric photoacoustic signal has a typical exponential relationship with the aggregation efficiency, which is defined as the percentage of aggregation molecules in the total molecules. Then, we proposed a ratiometric photoacoustic (PA) probe, which can be tailored by cathepsin E and self-assembled into nanofibers in situ inside pancreatic cancer cells. The maximum aggregation efficiency of 10-5 M PA probe was 58% after 2 hours of incubation. After intratumoral administration in xenografted pancreatic tumor mice, the highest aggregation efficiency was found to be 36% 6 hours after the injection. The ratiometric PA probe provides us with a real-time method to detect the aggregation efficiency in vivo, which is helpful to deepen the understanding of the dynamic assembly process and optimize the design of supramolecules."
Synthesis and characterization of multilayer graphene oxide on yttria-zirconia ceramics for dental implant,"In order to expand the family and improve the bioactivity of oral implant ceramics, the phase structures, mechanical and wetting properties of the hot-pressed yttria-zirconia/multilayer graphene oxide composite (3Y-ZrO2/GO) ceramics were investigated. GO was uniformly distributed in 3Y-ZrO2 powders, forming the C-O-Zr bond during the sintering process. In comparison to raw 3Y-ZrO2 ceramics, the flexural strength and fracture toughness improved up to 200% (1489.96 ± 35.71 MPa) in ZG3 (with 0.15 wt% GO) and 40.9% (8.95 ± 0.59 MPa m1/2) in ZG2 (with 0.1 wt% GO), respectively, while the relative density and Vickers hardness increased slightly. The toughening mechanisms included crack deflection, crack bridging, and GO put-out. Meanwhile, the composite ceramics were transformed into a more hydrophilic direction and indicated a good wetting property. In consideration of mechanical and wetting properties, the ZG3 would be a favorable alternative to the yttria-zirconia ceramic (Y-TZP) in dental implant applications. The results are expected to serve as a technical guidance for the fabrication and evaluation of dental implants."
Centimeter-deep NIR-II fluorescence imaging with nontoxic AIE probes in nonhuman primates,"Fluorescence probes with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics are of great importance in biomedical imaging with superior spatial and temporal resolution. However, the lack of toxicity studies and deep tissue imaging in nonhuman primates hinders their clinical translation. Here, we report the blood chemistry and histological analysis in nonhuman primates treated with AIE probes over tenfold of an intravenous dose of clinically used indocyanine green (ICG) during a study period of 36 days to demonstrate AIE probes are nontoxic. Furthermore, through bright and nontoxic AIE probes and fluorescence imaging in the second window (NIR-II, 1,000-1,700 nm), we achieve an unprecedented 1.5-centimeter-deep vascular imaging in nonhuman primates, breaking the current limitation of millimeter-deep NIR-II fluorescence imaging. Our important findings, i.e., nontoxic features of AIE probes and centimeter-deep NIR-II vascular imaging in nonhuman primates, may facilitate successful translation of AIE probes in clinical trials."
Enhanced Cancer DNA Vaccine via Direct Transfection to Host Dendritic Cells Recruited in Injectable Scaffolds,"Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccines are a promising cancer immunotherapy approach. However, effective delivery of DNA to antigen-presenting cells (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) for the induction of an adaptive immune response is limited. Conventional DNA delivery via intramuscular, intradermal, and subcutaneous injection by hypodermal needles shows a low potency and immunogenicity. Here, we propose the enhanced cancer DNA vaccine by direct transfection to the high number of DCs recruited into the chemoattractant-loaded injectable mesoporous silica microrods (MSRs). Subcutaneous administration of the MSRs mixed with tumor-antigen coding DNA polyplexes resulted in DC recruitment in the macroporous space of the scaffold formed by the spontaneous assembly of high-aspect-ratio MSRs, thereby allowing for enhanced cellular uptake of antigen-coded DNA by host DCs. The MSR scaffolds delivering the DNA vaccine trigger a more robust DC activation, antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response, and Th1 immune response compared to the bolus DNA vaccine. Additionally, the immunological memory can be induced with a single administration of the vaccine. The combination of the vaccination and antiprogrammed cell death-1 antibody significantly eliminates established lung metastasis. These results indicate that MSRs serve as a powerful platform for DNA vaccine delivery to DCs for effective cancer immunotherapy."
Hierarchical assembly of dual-responsive biomineralized polydopamine-calcium phosphate nanocomposites for enhancing chemo-photothermal therapy by autophagy inhibition,"The induction of autophagy in cancer cells would occur in response to several therapy strategies, including chemotherapy and photothermal therapy (PTT). Hence, combined autophagy inhibition has been regarded as a prevailing strategy to enhance treatment sensitivity in cancers. Herein, dual pH/thermal responsive biomineralized nanocomposites (PCNPs) were rationally designed and prepared based on the hierarchical assembly of calcium phosphate (CaP) and polydopamine (PDA). The first step in the self-assembly process involves the incorporation of hydrophobic chemotherapeutic docetaxel (DTX) into the CaP nanoparticles. Next, PDA was utilized as the coating to hierarchically self-assemble onto the surface of CaP through a simple self-polymerization of dopamine. Third, the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) was absorbed onto the surface of PDA via non-covalent interactions, forming PCNPs/DC. CQ was the only FDA approved autophagy inhibitor in clinical trials that could inhibit autophagosome fusion and degradation. The resulting PCNPs/DC could exhibit dual pH/thermal responsive properties due to the acid-sensitive CaP core and the photothermal effect of the PDA coating. Effective inhibition of autophagy in cancer cells could be realized by blocking the lysosome and weakening the degradation of autolysosomes by PCNPs/DC. Interestingly, complementary autophagy inhibition could therefore sensitize the effects of chemo-photothermal therapy both in vitro and in vivo with negligible toxicity. Therefore, these hierarchically assembled biomineralized nanocomposites would be used as a prevailing strategy to sensitize chemo-photothermal therapy by complementary autophagy inhibition."
Recent advances: Peptides and self-assembled peptide-nanosystems for antimicrobial therapy and diagnosis,"Bacterial infections, especially the refractory treatment of drug-resistant bacteria, are one of the greatest threats to human health. During the past decades, biomedical nanomaterials have been developed in an increasing number of fields, which significantly contribute to our public healthcare systems. Peptide-based drugs, such as antimicrobial peptides, cyclopeptides, and glycopeptides, play important roles in the treatment of drug-resistant bacterial infections, due to their unique lower resistance antibacterial mechanism. Among them, biomimetic nanostructures fabricated by self-assembled peptide nanomaterials have received considerable development in surface protection, tissue engineering, bactericides, etc. Besides, bacterial diagnostic reagents based on self-assembled peptide materials also provide strong support for early detection and infection imaging of bacterial infections. In this review, we have systematically discussed peptide-based self-assembled nanomaterials, including their sequences, subunits, secondary structures, assembled nanostructures, and biomedical applications for antibacterial therapy and diagnosis. We have reviewed and discussed the structure-function relationship, molecular design strategy, and structure effect of antimicrobial peptides. The sequence design of self-assembled peptides and the application of self-assembled peptide nanomaterials in the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections are emphasized. Also, we analyzed and summarized the design and development of smart materials, reviewed the innovative ""in vivo self-assembly""nanotechnology, and proposed the future design and prospect of smart self-assembly nanomaterials based on peptides in the biological antibacterial field."
Impact of the Physicochemical Features of TiO<inf>2</inf>Nanoparticles on Their in Vitro Toxicity,"The concern about titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) toxicity and their possible harmful effects on human health has increased. Their biological impact is related to some key physicochemical properties, that is, particle size, charge, crystallinity, shape, and agglomeration state. However, the understanding of the influence of such features on TiO2-NP toxicity remains quite limited. In this study, cytotoxicity, proinflammatory response, and oxidative stress caused by five types of TiO2-NPs with different physicochemical properties were investigated on A549 cells used either as monoculture or in co-culture with macrophages differentiated from the human monocytic THP-1 cells. We tailored bulk and surface TiO2 physicochemical properties and differentiated NPs for size/specific surface area, shape, agglomeration state, and surface functionalization/charge (aminopropyltriethoxysilane). An impact on the cytotoxicity and to a lesser extent on the proinflammatory responses depending on cell type was observed, namely, smaller, large-Agglomerated TiO2-NPs were shown to be less toxic than P25, whereas rod-shaped TiO2-NPs were found to be more toxic. Besides, the positively charged particle was slightly more toxic than the negatively charged one. Contrarily, TiO2-NPs, whatever their physicochemical properties, did not induce significant ROS production in both cell systems compared to nontreated control groups. These results may contribute to a better understanding of TiO2-NPs toxicity in relation with their physicochemical features."
Impact of ultrasonication on the delivered dose of metal oxide particle dispersions in vitro,"Particle dispersions with a stable size distribution are required to assess the risk of metal oxide nanopowders in cell culture experiments. The preparation process includes the disruption of larger particle aggregates and agglomerates by ultrasonication with a subsequent stabilization of the obtained particles. The applied particle dose during in vitro investigations may vary depending on particle diffusion and sedimentation processes, which are influenced by particle size and agglomeration behavior. The preparation process itself, as well as particle stability and dissolution, exert an influence on the physicochemical properties of the dispersed particles; they can decrease or increase delivered doses to the cellular system. The simulation of transport processes using the distorted grid (DG) and the three-dimensional sedimentation, diffusion, and dosimetry (3DSDD) models shows the influence of sonication treatment and the presence of stabilizing proteins in biological media for chosen metal oxide particles. This paper presents the effects of two different sonication methods (indirect and direct) on the delivered dose for different metal oxide nanopowders (CuO, MgO, and ZnO). Our results demonstrate that the use of less effective sonication power (indirect sonication) results in larger mean particle diameters and higher effective densities, leading to an increased delivered particle dose in vitro. For a higher effective acoustic power (direct sonication), the particle delivery decreased down to 20 % (for MgO) of the administered material; these data indicate that a large amount of particle material was not able to reach the cells. Thus, knowledge about preparation parameters of particle dispersions is required to generate comparable toxicological data with respect to the delivered dose."
CB1-Antibody Modified Liposomes for Targeted Modulation of Epileptiform Activities Synchronously Detected by Microelectrode Arrays,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a focal, recurrent, and refractory neurological disorder. Therefore, precisely targeted treatments for TLE are greatly needed. We designed anti-CB1 liposomes that can bind to CB1 receptors in the hippocampus to deliver photocaged compounds (ruthenium bipyridine triphenylphosphine γ-aminobutyric acid, RuBi-GABA) in the TLE rats. A 16-channel silicon microelectrode array (MEA) was implanted for simultaneously monitoring electrophysiological signals of neurons. The results showed that anti-CB1 liposomes were larger in size and remained in the hippocampus longer than unmodified liposomes. Following the blue light stimulation, the neural firing rates and the local field potentials of hippocampal neurons were significantly reduced. It is indicated that RuBi-GABA was enriched near hippocampal neurons due to anti-CB1 liposome delivery and photolyzed by optical stimulation, resulting dissociation of GABA to exert inhibitory actions. Furthermore, K-means cluster analysis revealed that the firing rates of interneurons were decreased to a greater extent than those of pyramidal neurons, which may have been a result of the uneven diffusion of RuBi-GABA due to liposomes binding to CB1. In this study, we developed a novel, targeted method to regulate neural electrophysiology in the hippocampus of the TLE rat using antibody-modified nanoliposomes, implantable MEA, and photocaged compounds. This method effectively suppressed hippocampal activities during seizure ictus with high spatiotemporal resolution, which is a crucial exploration of targeted therapy for epilepsy."
"Orally hypoglycemic activity of an insulin mimetic glycoprotein isolated from Cnidoscolus quercifolius Pohl. (Euphorbiaceae) seeds, Cq-IMP","The genus Cnidoscolus (Euphorbiaceae) is widely distributed in tropical areas. In the Northeast of Brazil, the species C. quercifolius is endemic and has been used in traditional medicine. In this study, a novel protein was isolated from C. quercifolius seeds and characterized by its molecular weight, primary structure, isoelectric point (pI), and carbohydrate content. The hypoglycemic activity of this protein was investigated by in vitro assay with the RIN-5F glucose-responsive cell line and in vivo test using alloxan-induced diabetic mice models. In addition, safe use of the protein was also investigated by cytotoxicity, hemagglutinating, and immunogenicity assays. The protein which was named Cq-IMP (Cnidoscolus quercifolius – Insulin Mimetic Protein) showed a single 11.18 KDa glycopolypeptide chain (16.4% of carbohydrates, m/m), pI of 8.0 and N-terminal sequence (TKDPELKQcKKQQKKqQQYDDDDKK) with similarity around 46–62% to sucrose binding protein-like and vicilin-like protein that was confirmed by mass spectrometry tryptic peptides analysis. Besides that, Cq-IMP presented anti-insulin antibody cross-reactivity as hypoglycemic activity in both in vitro and in vivo models. Additionally, it did not present any toxicity by methods tested. In conclusion, Cq-IMP is an insulin-mimetic protein, with a potent hypoglycemic activity and no toxicity showing great potential for therapeutic applications and drug development."
Phase and morphology evolution of high dielectric CoO/Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> particles with Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> nanoneedles on surface for excellent microwave absorption application,"Novel dual phased CoO/Co3O4 particles with Co3O4 nanoneedles on surface are obtained by annealing dual-phased Co (hexagonal and cubic phases) particles. Their phase and morphology evolution are clarified by XRD, SEM and TEM measurements. The early formed CoO and Co3O4 on surface from dual-phased Co promote the outdiffusion process of inside Co with kirkendall effect and restrict the growth of Co3O4 with a specific orientation, leading to the formation of Co3O4 nanoneedles on the surface. The microwave absorption measurement shows that the CoO/Co3O4 particles with annealing time of 1 h possess higher permittivity and better performances than pure Co and Co3O4 particles. An enhanced reflection loss (RL) value of −38.8 dB is obtained for the CoO/Co3O4-paraffin wax (PW) composite with a thickness of 2.8 mm. The absorption bandwidth for RL below −10 dB reaches 8.7 GHz. The Co3O4 nanoneedles on surface, porous structure and inner dual phased CoO/Co3O4 bring increased multiple reflection, interface/dipolar polarizations, conductive loss and better impedance matching. This clarification of phase and morphology evolution and novel CoO/Co3O4 material with nanoneedles on surface may provide new routes for designing high performance Co-based microwave absorbers with unique structures."
Graphdiyne:Structure of Fluorescent Quantum Dots,"Graphdiyne (GDY) as an emerging two-dimensional carbon allotrope exhibits excellent performance in energy chemistry, catalytic chemistry, optoelectronics, electronics, etc. because of the unique structure combining an sp- and sp2-hybrid carbon network. However, the poor solubility of pristine GDY is a major obstacle to its applications in many fields. Proposed here is a facile strategy to control the preparation of GDY quantum dots (GDY-Py QDs), in which pyrene groups are covalently linked to GDY by using a Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction. The as-prepared GDY-Py QDs, with an average diameter of about 3±0.1 nm, show superior dispersibility in many organic solvents and water. The GDY-Py QDs display not only bright fluorescent with a high relative quantum yield (QY) of 42.82 %, but they are also well-behaved as contrast agents in cell imaging. The GDY-Py QDs are bestowed with high stability and non-cytotoxicity, and exhibit long fluorescent times, and have potential for optical imaging and biomedical applications."
Recent Progress of Nanozymes in the Detection of Pathogenic Microorganisms,"Infectious diseases are among the world's principal health problems. It is crucial to develop rapid, accurate and cost-effective methods for the detection of pathogenic microorganisms. Recently, considerable progress has been achieved in the field of inorganic enzyme mimics (nanozymes). Compared with natural enzymes, nanozymes have higher stability and lower cost. More interestingly, their properties can be designed for various demands. Herein, we introduce the latest research progress on the detection of pathogenic microorganisms by using various nanozymes. We also discuss the current challenges of nanozymes in biosensing and provide some strategies to overcome these barriers."
The impact of nanotechnology in the current universal COVID-19 crisis. Let’s not forget nanosafety!,
Location of stimuli-responsive peptide sequences within silk-elastinlike protein-based polymers affects nanostructure assembly and drug–polymer interactions,"Silk-elastinlike protein polymers (SELPs) self-assemble into nanostructures when designed with appropriate silk-to-elastin ratios. Here, we investigate the effect of insertion of a matrix metalloproteinase-responsive peptide sequence, GPQGIFGQ, into various locations within the SELP backbone on supramolecular self-assembly. Insertion of the hydrophilic, enzyme-degradable sequence into the elastin repeats allows the formation of dilution-stable nanostructures, while insertion into the hydrophobic silk motifs inhibited self-assembly. The SELP assemblies retained their lower critical solution temperature (LCST) thermal response, allowing up to eightfold volumetric changes due to temperature-induced size change. A model hydrophobic drug was incorporated into SELP nanoassemblies utilising a combination of precipitation, incubation and tangential flow filtration. While the nanoconstructs degraded in response to MMP activity, drug release kinetics was independent of MMP concentration. Drug release modelling suggests that release is driven by rates of water penetration into the SELP nanostructures and drug dissolution. In vitro testing revealed that SELP nanoassemblies reduced the immunotoxic and haemolytic side effects of doxorubicin in human blood while maintaining its cytotoxic activity."
No small matter: A perspective on nanotechnology-enabled solutions to fight COVID-19,"There is an urgent need for safe and effective approaches to combat COVID-19. Here, we asked whether lessons learned from nanotoxicology and nanomedicine could shed light on the current pandemic. SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent, may trigger a mild, self-limiting disease with respiratory symptoms, but patients may also succumb to a life-threatening systemic disease. The host response to the virus is equally complex and studies are now beginning to unravel the immunological correlates of COVID-19. Nanotechnology can be applied for the delivery of antiviral drugs or other repurposed drugs. Moreover, recent work has shown that synthetic nanoparticles wrapped with host-derived cellular membranes may prevent virus infection. We posit that nanoparticles decorated with ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, could be exploited as decoys to intercept the virus before it infects cells in the respiratory tract. However, close attention should be paid to biocompatibility before such nano-decoys are deployed in the clinic."
Identification of New Nitric Oxide-Donating Peptides with Dual Biofilm Eradication and Antibacterial Activities for Intervention of Device-Related Infections,"Implantable medical device-related infections with biofilms have become a significant challenge in clinics. Based on the potential bacteria biofilm dispersing effect of nitric oxide (NO) and the unique antibacterial activity of antimicrobial peptides (AMP), we synthesized five peptides and selected the most potent one to conjugate its N-terminal with a furoxan moiety to offer a hitherto unknown NO-donating antimicrobial peptide (FOTyr-AMP), which exhibited Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli biofilm dispersion and eradication, and potent antibacterial activities in vitro. In an implanted biofilm infection mice model, topical subcutaneous injection of FOTyr-AMP allowed synergetic eradication of bacterial biofilms and potent antibacterial activity, superior to the antibiotic cephalosporin C. Given the low hemolysis effect, little influence on the blood pressure, and potent in vivo efficacy of FOTyr-AMP, it is clear that subcutaneous administration of FOTyr-AMP could be a promising approach for the intervention of medical device-related biofilm infections with desirable safety."
Click Reaction-Assisted Peptide Immune Checkpoint Blockade for Solid Tumor Treatment,"One of the major challenges of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is the poor penetration of antibody for solid tumor treatment. Herein, peptides with deeper penetration capability are used to develop a click reaction-assisted peptide immune checkpoint blockade (CRICB) strategy that could in situ construct assemblies, enabling enhanced accumulation and prolonged PD-L1 occupancy, ultimately realizing high-performance tumor inhibition. First, the free DBCO-modified targeting peptide (TP) efficiently recognizes and binds PD-L1 in a deep solid tumor. Upon a reagent-free click reaction with a subsequently introduced azide-tethered assembled peptide (AP), the click reaction results in spontaneous self-aggregation in situ with enhanced accumulation and prolonged occupancy. In addition, the penetration of TP-AP (121.2 ± 15.5 μm) is significantly enhanced compared with that of an antibody (19.9 ± 5.6 μm) in a solid tumor tissue. More importantly, significant immunotherapy effects and negligible side effects are observed in 4T1 and CT26 tumor-bearing mice models treated with TP-AP, suggesting the high-performance tumor inhibition attributed to the CRICB strategy. In summary, this CRICB strategy manifest the preferable effects of immune checkpoint blockade, thereby extending the biomedical application of assembling peptides."
A chlorin-lipid nanovesicle nucleus drug for amplified therapeutic effects of lung cancer by internal radiotherapy combined with the Cerenkov radiation-induced photodynamic therapy,"Traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT) requires external light excitation to produce reactive oxygen species (ROSs) for the treatment of tumors. Due to problems of light penetration, traditional PDT is limited by the location and depth of the tumor. In this study, we rationally designed and constructed a novel strategy to amplify the therapeutic effect of PDT. We prepared a chlorin-lipid nanovesicle based on the conjugates of chlorin e6 (Ce 6) and phospholipids, with the surface conjugating the aptamer for lung cancer targeting, GLT21.T. 131I-labeled bovine serum albumin (131I-BSA) was loaded into the chlorin-lipid nanovesicle cavity (131I-BSA@LCN-Apt). 131I not only plays a role in radiotherapy, but its Cerenkov radiation (CR), as an internal light source, can also stimulate Ce6 to produce ROSs without external light excitation. The in vitro and in vivo therapeutic effects in subcutaneous lung tumor models and orthotopic lung tumor models indicated that 131I-BSA@LCN-Apt produced a powerful anti-tumor effect through synergistic radiotherapy and CR-PDT, which almost caused complete tumor growth regression. After treatment, the survival time of the mice was significantly prolonged. During the treatment, no obvious side effects were found by histopathology of important organs, hematology and biochemistry analysis except the decrease of the white blood cell count (WBC). The study provides a major tool for deep-seated tumors to obtain amplified therapeutic effects by synergistic radiotherapy and CR-PDT without the use of any external light source."
How can nanotechnology help to combat COVID-19? Opportunities and urgent need,"Incidents of viral outbreaks have increased at an alarming rate over the past decades. The most recent human coronavirus known as COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has already spread around the world and shown R0 values from 2.2 to 2.68. However, the ratio between mortality and number of infections seems to be lower in this case in comparison to other human coronaviruses (such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)). These outbreaks have tested the limits of healthcare systems and have posed serious questions about management using conventional therapies and diagnostic tools. In this regard, the use of nanotechnology offers new opportunities for the development of novel strategies in terms of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and other viral infections. In this review, we discuss the use of nanotechnology for COVID-19 virus management by the development of nano-based materials, such as disinfectants, personal protective equipment, diagnostic systems and nanocarrier systems, for treatments and vaccine development, as well as the challenges and drawbacks that need addressing.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]"
Evaluating UiO-66 Metal-Organic Framework Nanoparticles as Acid-Sensitive Carriers for Pulmonary Drug Delivery Applications,"Developing novel drug carriers for pulmonary delivery is necessary to achieve higher efficacy and consistency for treating pulmonary diseases while limiting off-target side effects that occur from alternative routes of administration. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as a class of materials with characteristics well-suited for pulmonary drug delivery, with chemical tunability, high surface area, and pore size, which will allow for efficient loading of therapeutic cargo and deep lung penetration. UiO-66, a zirconium and terephthalic acid-based MOF, has displayed notable chemical and physical stability and potential biocompatibility; however, its feasibility for use as a pulmonary drug delivery vehicle has yet to be examined. Here, we evaluate the use of UiO-66 nanoparticles (NPs) as novel pulmonary drug delivery vehicles and assess the role of missing linker defects in their utility for this application. We determined that missing linker defects result in differences in NP aerodynamics but have minimal effects on the loading of model and therapeutic cargo, cargo release, biocompatibility, or biodistribution. This is a critical result, as it indicates the robust consistency of UiO-66, a critical feature for pulmonary drug delivery, which is plagued by inconsistent dosage because of variable properties. Not only that, but UiO-66 NPs also demonstrate pH-dependent stability, with resistance to degradation in extracellular conditions and breakdown in intracellular environments. Furthermore, the carriers exhibit high biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity in vitro and are well-tolerated in in vivo murine evaluations of orotracheally administered NPs. Following pulmonary delivery, UiO-66 NPs remain localized to the lungs before clearance over the course of seven days. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using UiO-66 NPs as a novel platform for pulmonary drug delivery through their tunable NP properties, which allow for controlled aerodynamics and internalization-dependent cargo release while displaying remarkable pulmonary biocompatibility."
Study on Fe3O4 Magnetic Nanoparticles Size Effect on Temperature Distribution of Tumor in Hyperthermia: A Finite Element Method,"In recent years, Hyperthermia has been used as an emerging technique for cancer treatment, especially for localized tumors. One of the promising cancer treatment approaches is magnetic nanoparticle (MNPs) Hyperthermia. In this theoretical work, the temperature distribution of a common tumor over the different sizes of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles, namely 25, 50, 100, and 200 nm, was studied via the finite element method. A two-dimensional method was used to simulate the tumor tissue, in which nanoparticles were incorporated and dispersed into the tumor uniformly. The bio heat transfer equation (BHTE) was applied to calculate the thermal processes in the human body. Results elucidated that decreasing magnetic nanoparticle size caused more temperature rise in the tumor cell during the Hyperthermia treatment, which led to better performance of the treatment. Finally, simulation results showed that the Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles with the sizes of 50-100 nm were applicable for Hyperthermia therapy with the optimum cellular uptake."
Nanotechnology-based medical devices for the treatment of chronic skin lesions: From research to the clinic,"Chronic wounds, such as pressure ulcers, diabetic ulcers, venous ulcers and arterial insufficiency ulcers, are lesions that fail to proceed through the normal healing process within a period of 12 weeks. The treatment of skin chronic wounds still represents a great challenge. Wound medical devices (MDs) range from conventional and advanced dressings, up to skin grafts, but none of these are generally recognized as a gold standard. Based on recent developments, this paper reviews nanotechnology‐based medical devices intended as skin substitutes. In particular, nanofibrous scaffolds are promising platforms for wound healing, especially due to their similarity to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and their capability to promote cell adhesion and proliferation, and to restore skin integrity, when grafted into the wound site. Nanotechnology‐based scaffolds are emphasized here. The discussion will be focused on the definition of critical quality attributes (chemical and physical characterization, stability, particle size, surface properties, release of nanoparticles from MDs, sterility and apyrogenicity), the preclinical evaluation (biocompatibility testing, alternative in vitro tests for irritation and sensitization, wound healing test and animal wound models), the clinical evaluation and the CE (European Conformity) marking of nanotechnology‐based MDs."
Toxic effects of hydroxyl-and amine-functionalized silica nanoparticles (SiO<inf>2</inf> and NH2-SiO<inf>2</inf> NPs) on caenorhabditis elegans,"Silica nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs) are engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) that have a wide range of application. Increased use in manufacturing has led to concerns about their environmental impact and possible adverse health effects. We conducted a comparative toxicity assessment of bare SiO2-NPs and amine-functionalized SiO2 NPs (NH2-SiO2 NPs) utilizing the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) in vivo model. L1 nematodes were exposed to exposure concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 2.5, and 5 mg mL–1 until the worms reached the L4 stage. The chronic lethality and lifespan assays revealed a significant decrease in survival rate and lifespan at 2.5 and 5 mg mL–1 for nematodes exposed to bare SiO2 NPs (89% and 88%; 22 days, p < 0.05 and 14 days, p < 0.05) and at 5 mg mL–1 for the NH2-SiO2 NPs-exposed group (86%; 20 days, p < 0.001). Exposure to all SiO2 NP concentrations reduced progeny production to 79–60% while exposure to 2.5 and 5 mg mL–1 of NH2-SiO2 NPs significantly reduced the brood size to 64–63%. Neurobehavioral toxicity was also observed in the SiO2 NP-exposed worms, which displayed significantly decreased head thrashing for up to 92–71% and in the NH2-SiO2 NPs-exposed worms which showed significantly reduced head thrashing movement for up to 91–85% at concentrations of 0.5-5 mg mL–1. Body bending movements were also significantly reduced at 0.5–5 mg mL–1 SiO2 NPs (71–34%) and 2.5–5 mg mL–1 NH2-SiO2 NPs (94–66%). Significant shortening of body size was also observed in nematodes exposed to 0.5–5 mg mL–1 for both SiO2 NPs (93–81%) and NH2-SiO2 NPs (94–88%). Overall, bare SiO2 NPs were observed to be more toxic due to the negatively charged surface OH groups, which may have disrupted protein homeostasis, resulting in the observed toxicities. We suggest that functionality is an important indicator in nanosafety evaluations."
A critical review of single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry-A step towards an ideal method for nanomaterial characterization,"Single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (spICP-MS or SP-ICP-MS depending on the author) is becoming an important tool for the characterization of nanoparticles (NPs). The method allows determining the size, size distribution, and particle number concentrations of NPs in suspensions after a mere few minutes of measurement. This review is modeled after the concept of ""an ideal method for atomic spectroscopy""introduced by Gary M. Hieftje in his publication dedicated to Howard Malmstadt. This review discusses the instrumental developments in spICP-MS of recent years step-by-step, from the sample introduction system to the detector. The authors identify necessary improvements and suggest directions for further developments which have the potential to bring the method closer to ""an ideal method for atomic spectroscopy"". The review also discusses the literature on coupling spICP-MS to separation and fractionation techniques including capillary electrophoresis (CE), field flow fractionation (FFF), and differential mobility analysis (DMA). The second part of the review is dedicated to the applications of spICP-MS. Key steps in sample preparation and selected instrumental conditions that were used in the published literature are summarized in a tabular form. Most frequently, spICP-MS is used for silver (Ag), gold (Au), and titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanomaterial analysis. Data acquisition was typically performed with millisecond dwell times in the past while a time resolution of hundreds of microseconds has been used more often in the last five years. The table may serve as a guide to choose an experimental procedure depending on the matrix that is present in the sample under investigation."
Utilization of carbon nanotubes in manufacturing of 3D cartilage and bone scaffolds,"Cartilage and bone injuries are prevalent ailments, affecting the quality of life of injured patients. Current methods of treatment are often imperfect and pose the risk of complications in the long term. Therefore, tissue engineering is a rapidly developing branch of science, which aims at discovering effective ways of replacing or repairing damaged tissues with the use of scaffolds. However, both cartilage and bone owe their exceptional mechanical properties to their complex ultrastructure, which is very difficult to reproduce artificially. To address this issue, nanotechnology was employed. One of the most promising nanomaterials in this respect is carbon nanotubes, due to their exceptional physico-chemical properties, which are similar to collagens-the main component of the extracellular matrix of these tissues. This review covers the important aspects of 3D scaffold development and sums up the existing research tackling the challenges of scaffold design. Moreover, carbon nanotubes-reinforced bone and cartilage scaffolds manufactured using the 3D bioprinting technique will be discussed as a novel tool that could facilitate the achievement of more biomimetic structures."
"Characterization of commercial metal oxide nanomaterials: Crystalline phase, particle size and specific surface area","Physical chemical characterization of nanomaterials is critical to assessing quality control during production, evaluating the impact of material properties on human health and the environment, and developing regulatory frameworks for their use. We have investigated a set of 29 nanomaterials from four metal oxide families (aluminum, copper, titanium and zinc) with a focus on the measurands that are important for the basic characterization of dry nanomaterials and the determination of the dose metrics for nanotoxicology. These include crystalline phase and crystallite size, measured by powder X-ray diffraction, particle shape and size distributions from transmission electron microscopy, and specific surface area, measured by gas adsorption. The results are compared to the nominal data provided by the manufacturer, where available. While the crystalline phase data are generally reliable, data on minor components that may impact toxicity is often lacking. The crystal and particle size data highlight the issues in obtaining size measurements of materials with broad size distributions and significant levels of aggregation, and indicate that reliance on nominal values provided by the manufacturer is frequently inadequate for toxicological studies aimed at identifying differences between nanoforms. The data will be used for the development of models and strategies for grouping and read-across to support regulatory human health and environmental assessments of metal oxide nanomaterials."
Biocompatibility of biomaterials for nanoencapsulation: Current approaches,"Nanoencapsulation is an approach to circumvent shortcomings such as reduced bioavailability, undesirable side effects, frequent dosing and unpleasant organoleptic properties of conventional drug delivery systems. The process of nanoencapsulation involves the use of biomaterials such as surfactants and/or polymers, often in combination with charge inducers and/or ligands for targeting. The biomaterials selected for nanoencapsulation processes must be as biocompatible as possible. The type(s) of biomaterials used for different nanoencapsulation approaches are highlighted and their use and applicability with regard to haemo-and, histocompatibility, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenesis are discussed."
Rethinking Nanosafety Part II: Leveraging Progress to Pioneer New Approaches and Solutions,
Development of Deep Learning Models for Predicting the Effects of Exposure to Engineered Nanomaterials on Daphnia magna,"This study presents the results of applying deep learning methodologies within the ecotoxicology field, with the objective of training predictive models that can support hazard assessment and eventually the design of safer engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). A workflow applying two different deep learning architectures on microscopic images of Daphnia magna is proposed that can automatically detect possible malformations, such as effects on the length of the tail, and the overall size, and uncommon lipid concentrations and lipid deposit shapes, which are due to direct or parental exposure to ENMs. Next, classification models assign specific objects (heart, abdomen/claw) to classes that depend on lipid densities and compare the results with controls. The models are statistically validated in terms of their prediction accuracy on external D. magna images and illustrate that deep learning technologies can be useful in the nanoinformatics field, because they can automate time-consuming manual procedures, accelerate the investigation of adverse effects of ENMs, and facilitate the process of designing safer nanostructures. It may even be possible in the future to predict impacts on subsequent generations from images of parental exposure, reducing the time and cost involved in long-term reproductive toxicity assays over multiple generations."
The effect of PEGylated iron oxide nanoparticles on sheep ovarian tissue: An ex-vivo nanosafety study,"Today, nanotechnology plays an important role in our ever-continuous quest to improve the quality of human life. Because of their infinitesimal size, nanostructures can actively interact and alter cellular functions. Therefore, while the clinical benefits of nanotechnology may outweigh most of the associated risks, assessment of the cytotoxicity of nanostructures in respect to cells and tissues early in product development processes is of great significance. To the best of our knowledge, no such assessment has been performed for nanomaterials on the ovarian cortex before. Herein, silica-coated, PEGylated silica-coated, and uncoated iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) with core diameter of 11 nm (±4.2 nm) were synthesized. The oxidative stress in cultured ovarian tissue exposed to the various IONP was subsequently assessed. The results indicate that among the four groups, uncoated IONP induce the most oxidative stress on the ovarian cortex while tissues treated with PEGylated IONP exhibit no significant change in oxidative stress."
"Molecular interaction, chain conformation, and rheological modification during electrospinning of hyaluronic acid aqueous solution","Most of natural water-soluble polymers are difficult to electrospin due to their specific chain conformation in aqueous solution, which limits their applications. This study investigated the effects of polyethylene oxide (PEO) on the electrospinning of hyaluronic acid (HA) in HA/PEO aqueous solutions. The rheological properties of HA/PEO aqueous solutions showed polymer chain entanglement in HA was the essential factor affecting its electrospinnability. Wide-angle X-ray scattering and differential scanning calorimetry analyses of a PEO crystal showed different crystallization behavior of the PEO chain with different molecular weight, which indicates different interaction with HA. A schematic molecular model has been proposed to explain the effect of PEO on the chain conformation of HA along with the relationship between electrospinnability and chain entanglement. PEO with a relatively high molecular weight with limited crystal formation formed extensive chain entanglements with HA, while PEO with relatively low molecular weight weakened the interactions among HA chains. The findings of this study provide a wide perspective to better understand the electrospinning mechanisms of natural polyelectrolytes and usage in tissue engineering."
Third-Generation Solar Cells: Toxicity and Risk of Exposure,"Solar energy is considered clean energy, and its use is predicted to increase in the near future. Most installed units today are crystalline solar cells, but the field is in constant development, and when the first dye sensitized solar cell was published by Grätzel and O'Reagan a new, third-generation, solar power was born. Highly toxic metals are used to produce the photovoltaic units today, and with the predicted increase in solar cell installation, the human health hazards of these panels could become an issue. Additionally, many of these materials are used in their nanoform, which is associated with an additional risk. In this article, we discuss the technology behind the third-generation solar cells with its valuable use of nanotechnology as well as the possible health hazard when such nanomaterials are used in solar power units. We will show that the main exposure will occur either during the development and production phases or at the end-of-life stage of the solar cells, where toxic material can leach into landfills, and subsequently into the environment and impact the ecosystem directly, or humans indirectly through edible plants or drinking water."
"<sup>44</sup>Ti diffusion labelling of commercially available, engineered TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles","In realistic exposure scenarios, the detection and quantification of engineered nanoparticles in complex environmental or biological matrixes is a challenge since nanoparticle concentrations are frequently low and have to be discerned from a background that may contain the same elements in various chemical forms in much higher concentrations. The use of radiolabelled nanoparticles may overcome these difficulties offering high detection sensitivity without the necessity of complex sample preparation procedures. However, the labelling procedure must not alter the physicochemical and biological properties of the nanoparticles. In the present work, the radiolabelling of three different types of TiO2 nanoparticles with primary particle sizes between 5 nm and 26 nm with commercially available 44Ti has been investigated applying a simple diffusion heat treatment at 180 °C for 2.5 h on nanoparticles impregnated with a solution containing the 44Ti radiolabel. The same treatment has been investigated to radiolabel amorphous SiO2 nanoparticles with 44Ti. The radiolabels are stably integrated in the nanoparticle matrix, and the release is less than 0.1% in aqueous suspension at neutral pH for at least 4 weeks. The method appears to be fast and reliable. By transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering and ζ-potential measurements, only minor alterations of the nanoparticle size could be detected in the range of 1 to 2 nm."
Adhesion and cytotoxicity of positively charged nanoparticles toward budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe,"It is of great significance to examine the adverse effects of nanoparticles (NPs) on the environments and human health. In the present study, we have investigated the toxicological effects of NPs on two distinct strains of yeast, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, in aqueous solutions of NaCl. The positively charged NPs of 100-nm diameter were more significantly adhered on (and uptaken by) a negatively charged cell of every yeast strain at lower ionic strength. Every yeast in 150-mM NaCl solution (high ionic strength) showed the cell viability of more than 80% even after exposure to 100-μg/mL NPs, whereas in 5-mM NaCl solution (low ionic strength) it exhibited zero cell viability at 25-μg/mL NPs. Interestingly, the dead cells in 5-mM NaCl solution containing 6.25–12.5 μg/mL NPs exhibited about 2-fold amount of cellular adhesion/uptake of NPs, compared with the corresponding live cells. The ratio between the saturated amounts of the cellular adhesion/uptake of NPs in 5-mM and 150-mM NaCl solutions for S. cerevisiae was about eighteen times greater than that for S. pombe. This behavior of S. cerevisiae is explained in part by the larger ratio between the zeta potentials of a cell in 5-mM and 150-mM NaCl solutions."
An Alternative Perspective towards Reducing the Risk of Engineered Nanomaterials to Human Health,"To elucidate the impact of human exposure to engineered nanomaterials, advanced in vitro models are a valid non-animal alternative. Despite significant gains over the last decade, implementation of these approaches remains limited. This work discusses the current state-of-the-art and how future developments can lead to advanced in vitro models better supporting nano-hazard assessment."
Persistent Regulation of Tumor Hypoxia Microenvironment via a Bioinspired Pt-Based Oxygen Nanogenerator for Multimodal Imaging-Guided Synergistic Phototherapy,"Multifunctional nanoplatforms for imaging-guided synergistic antitumor treatment are highly desirable in biomedical applications. However, anticancer treatment is largely affected by the pre-existing hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME), which not only causes the resistance of the tumors to photodynamic therapy (PDT), but also promotes tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Here, a continuous O2 self-enriched nanoplatform is constructed for multimodal imaging-guided synergistic phototherapy based on octahedral gold nanoshells (GNSs), which are constructed by a more facile and straightforward one-step method using platinum (Pt) nanozyme-decorated metal–organic frameworks (MOF) as the inner template. The Pt-decorated MOF@GNSs (PtMGs) are further functionalized with human serum albumin-chelated gadolinium (HSA-Gd, HGd) and loaded with indocyanine green (ICG) (ICG-PtMGs@HGd) to achieve a synergistic PDT/PTT effect and fluorescence (FL)/multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT)/X-ray computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The Pt-decorated nanoplatform endows remarkable catalase-like behavior and facilitates the continuous decomposition of the endogenous H2O2 into O2 to enhance the PDT effect under hypoxic TME. HSA modification enhances the biocompatibility and tumor-targeting ability of the nanocomposites. This TME-responsive and O2 self-supplement nanoparticle holds great potential as a multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform for the multimodal imaging-guided synergistic phototherapy of solid tumors."
Risk Governance of Emerging Technologies Demonstrated in Terms of its Applicability to Nanomaterials,"Nanotechnologies have reached maturity and market penetration that require nano-specific changes in legislation and harmonization among legislation domains, such as the amendments to REACH for nanomaterials (NMs) which came into force in 2020. Thus, an assessment of the components and regulatory boundaries of NMs risk governance is timely, alongside related methods and tools, as part of the global efforts to optimise nanosafety and integrate it into product design processes, via Safe(r)-by-Design (SbD) concepts. This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art regarding risk governance of NMs and lays out the theoretical basis for the development and implementation of an effective, trustworthy and transparent risk governance framework for NMs. The proposed framework enables continuous integration of the evolving state of the science, leverages best practice from contiguous disciplines and facilitates responsive re-thinking of nanosafety governance to meet future needs. To achieve and operationalise such framework, a science-based Risk Governance Council (RGC) for NMs is being developed. The framework will provide a toolkit for independent NMs' risk governance and integrates needs and views of stakeholders. An extension of this framework to relevant advanced materials and emerging technologies is also envisaged, in view of future foundations of risk research in Europe and globally."
Embedding Ethical Impact Assessment in Nanosafety Decision Support,"Nanotechnology is a key enabling technology, which is developing fast and influences many aspects of life. Nanomaterials are already included in a broad range of products and industrial sectors. Nanosafety issues are still a matter of concern for policy makers and stakeholders, but currently, there is no platform where all stakeholders can meet and discuss these issues. A comprehensive overview of all the issues in one single dashboard presenting the output of a decision support system is also lacking. This article outlines a strategy for developing one innovative part of a modular decision support system, designed to support the work of a new Risk Governance Council (RGC) for nanomaterials which will be established through the combined efforts of the GOV4NANO, NANORIGO, and RiskGONE H2020 projects. This new module will consist of guidelines for Ethical Impact Assessment (EIA) for nanomaterials and nanoenabled products. This article offers recommendations for adapting the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) prestandard on Ethical Impact Assessment CWA (CEN Workshop Agreement) 17145-2:2017 (E), to fit into the more-encompassing decision support system for risk governance of nanomaterials within the RiskGONE project."
"Nanocharacterization, Materials Modeling, and Research Integrity as Enablers of Sound Risk Assessment: Designing Responsible Nanotechnology","Nanotechnology, as a mature enabling technology, has great potential to boost societal welfare. However, nanomaterials' current and foreseen applications raise serious concerns about their impact on human health and the environment. These concerns emerge because a reliable risk assessment in nanotechnology is yet to be achieved. The reasons for such a shortcoming are the inherent difficulties in characterizing nanomaterials properties. The interaction of characterization with modeling is an open issue and, due to overarching concerns about the reliability of research results, usually framed within the context of research integrity. This essay explores the connection between these different, but deeply intertwined concerns and the way they enable the production of responsible nanotechnology, i.e., nanotechnology devoted to societal welfare."
Endosomal Escape of Polymer-Coated Silica Nanoparticles in Endothelial Cells,"Current investigations into hazardous nanoparticles (i.e., nanotoxicology) aim to understand the working mechanisms that drive toxicity. This understanding has been used to predict the biological impact of the nanocarriers as a function of their synthesis, material composition, and physicochemical characteristics. It is particularly critical to characterize the events that immediately follow cell stress resulting from nanoparticle internalization. While reactive oxygen species and activation of autophagy are universally recognized as mechanisms of nanotoxicity, the progression of these phenomena during cell recovery has yet to be comprehensively evaluated. Herein, primary human endothelial cells are exposed to controlled concentrations of polymer-functionalized silica nanoparticles to induce lysosomal damage and achieve cytosolic delivery. In this model, the recovery of cell functions lost following endosomal escape is primarily represented by changes in cell distribution and the subsequent partitioning of particles into dividing cells. Furthermore, multilamellar bodies are found to accumulate around the particles, demonstrating progressive endosomal escape. This work provides a set of biological parameters that can be used to assess cell stress related to nanoparticle exposure and the subsequent recovery of cell processes as a function of endosomal escape."
Position-coded multivalent peptide–peptide interactions revealed by tryptophan-scanning mutagenesis,"We demonstrate in this contribution the evidence that significant cooperative binding effect can be identified for the amino acid sites that are determinant to the binding characteristics in peptide–peptide interactions. The analysis of tryptophan-scanning mutagenesis of the 14-mer peptide consisting only of glycine provides a mapping of position-dependent contributions to the binding energy. The pronounced tryptophan-associated peptide–peptide interactions are originated from the indole moieties with the main chains of 14-mer glycines containing N–H and C-O moieties. Specifically, with the presence of two tryptophans as determinant amino acids, cooperative binding can be observed, which are dependent on relative positions of the two tryptophans with a “volcano”-like characteristics. An optimal separation of 6–10 amino acids between two adjacent binding sites can be identified to achieve maximal binding interactions."
In Vivo Genome Engineering for the Treatment of Muscular Dystrophies,"Purpose of Review: Muscular dystrophies (MDs) are a heterogeneous collection of inherited disorders which cause progressive muscle loss and weakness/hypotonia. Owing to the genetic root of MDs, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has been investigated as a possible therapy, with significant advancements having been made. This review aims to provide an overview of recent progress on the in vivo utilization of CRISPR/Cas9 in MD animal models. Recent Findings: Three primary methods for correcting MD with CRISPR/Cas9 exist: restoration of the full-length protein, restoration of a truncated but partially functional protein, and modulation of gene expression. All these approaches have been (DMD) models with varying degrees of success. In congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A) mice, full-length protein restoration and disease modifier upregulation strategies significantly improved the phenotype. Lastly, efficient elimination of pathogenic CTG repeats via CRISPR/Cas9 was achieved in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) mice. Delivery of CRISPR machinery into MD animals was frequently accomplished with adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), which currently significantly outperform nanoparticle-based delivery. The targeting of satellite cells in vivo by AAVs has been evaluated by several groups in DMD mice, yielding conflicting results which require clarification. Summary: Partial or nearly complete phenotypic rescue has been achieved in DMD, MDC1A, and DM1 animals with numerous CRISPR/Cas9 strategies. While considerable work will be necessary to advance CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing past preclinical stages, its therapeutic potential for MD is extremely promising and warrants the investment."
"Bioaccumulation of ytterbium oxide nanoparticles insinuate oxidative stress, inflammatory, and pathological lesions in ICR mice","With the rapid development in nanoscience and nanotechnology, rare earth oxide nanomaterials (REO-NMs) have been increasingly used due to their unique physical and chemical characteristics. Despite the increasing applications of REO NPs, scarce information is available on their detrimental effects. In the current study, we investigate the toxic effect of ytterbium oxide nanoparticles (Yb2O3 NPs) in mouse model by using various techniques including inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis over 30 days of exposure. Furthermore, we elucidated lung lavage fluid of mice for biochemical and cytological analysis, and lung tissues for histopathology to interpret the NP side effects. We observed a significant concentration of Yb2O3 NPs accumulated in the lung, liver, kidney, and heart tissues. Similarly, increased bioaccumulation of Yb content was found in the olfactory bulb compared to other reigns of brain. The cytological analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) revealed a significant elevation in the percentage of neutrophils and lymphocytes. Biochemical analysis showed an instilled Yb2O3 NPs, showing signs of oxidative damage through up-regulation of 60–87% of MDA while down-regulation of 20–40% of GSH-PX and GSH content. The toxicity pattern was more evident from histopathological observations. These interpretations provide enough evidence of bioaccumulation of Yb2O3 NPs in mice tissues. Overall, our findings reveal that acute exposure of Yb2O3 NPs through intranasal inhalation may cause toxicity via oxidative stress, which leads to a chronic inflammatory response.

Role of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Nanosafety,"Robotics and automation provide potentially paradigm shifting improvements in the way materials are synthesized and characterized, generating large, complex data sets that are ideal for modeling and analysis by modern machine learning (ML) methods. Nanomaterials have not yet fully captured the benefits of automation, so lag behind in the application of ML methods of data analysis. Here, some key developments in, and roadblocks to the application of ML methods are reviewed to model and predict potentially adverse biological and environmental effects of nanomaterials. This work focuses on the diverse ways a range of ML algorithms are applied to understand and predict nanomaterials properties, provides examples of the application of traditional ML and deep learning methods to nanosafety, and provides context and future perspectives on developments that are likely to occur, or need to occur in the near future that allow artificial intelligence to make a deeper contribution to nanosafety."
Transformation of Nanomaterials and Its Implications in Gut Nanotoxicology,"Ingestion of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) is inevitable due to their widespread utilization in the agrifood industry. Safety evaluation has become pivotal to identify the consequences on human health of exposure to these ingested ENMs. Much of the current understanding of nanotoxicology in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is derived from studies utilizing pristine ENMs. In reality, agrifood ENMs interact with their microenvironment, and undergo multiple physicochemical transformations, such as aggregation/agglomeration, dissolution, speciation change, and surface characteristics alteration, across their life cycle from synthesis to consumption. This work sieves out the implications of ENM transformations on their behavior, stability, and reactivity in food and product matrices and through the GIT, in relation to measured toxicological profiles. In particular, a strong emphasis is given to understand the mechanisms through which these transformations can affect ENM induced gut nanotoxicity."
Workers’ exposure to nano-objects in R&amp;D laboratories: An integrated risk management and communication approach,"The growing development of emerging and enabling technologies, including nanotechnologies, calls for a responsible approach to identify, evaluate, prevent and communicate health and safety (H&S) concerns related to them. This study proposes a methodology to manage the potential risks related to research and development (R&D) activities on nanomaterials (NMs), combining qualitative risk evaluation, on-site exposure assessment and communication tools. This methodology gives an example of an evidence-based approach to address uncertainties related to workers’ exposure in NMs use and production. It originates from a standardized Control Banding (CB) approach, in which the hazard bands are combined with the exposure potential, in order to define the level of control measures required in the workplace. Field measurements, data collection and off-line analysis have been employed to integrate the CB model and to obtain an improved risk management tool. It has been tested in a R&D laboratory in which NMs with different dimensionalities were manufactured and used: graphene, nanowires and nanoparticles. The final outcome is a risk analysis included in a pictogram (NanoLabel) associated to each process phase and laboratory, indicating the specific level of risk and primary management measures, addressed to R&D personnel, H&S players and other workers involved. It is a dynamic system that can be adapted to the different R&D activities and to the different competences and skills of target personnel. Results shows the approach address workers’ exposure to NMs with promising applications also in industrial contexts."
A review on nanocellulose as a lightweight filler of polyolefin composites,"Nanocellulose (NC) possesses low density, high aspect ratio, impressive mechanical properties, nanoscale dimensions, which shows huge potential applications as a reinforced filler. Polyolefin (PO), represented by polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), has been widely used in industries. Recently nanocellulose/polyolefin nanocomposites (NC/PO nanocomposites) have caught more attention from the application of automotive components, aerospace, furniture, building, home appliances, and sport. In this review, the surface modifications of nanocellulose and polyolefin are summarized respectively, such as surface adsorption modification, small molecule modification, and graft copolymerization modification. The common preparations of NC/PO nanocomposites are discussed, including the melting compounding, the solvent casting, and the in-situ polymerization. The lightweight, mechanical properties, and aging-resistant properties of NC/PO nanocomposites are highlighted. Finally, the potentials and challenges for industrial production development of NC/PO nanocomposites are discussed."
Nanoadsorbents for wastewater treatment: next generation biotechnological solution,"Day by day, the water sources are increasingly being adulterated due to various reasons including the uncontrolled discharge of pollutants from the point and nonpoint sources. Therefore, it is a timely need to develop suitable, inexpensive and efficient treatment techniques for water purification. This review aims at evaluating different water treatment technologies, their basic principles, cost and suitability for pollutants’ removal from wastewater. Among various water treatment technologies, adsorption technique appears to be techno-economically more attractive due to its inexpensiveness, universality and environment friendliness. Here, wide varieties of adsorbents (silica gel, activated alumina, clays, limestone, chitosan, activated carbon, zeolite, etc.) and their capacities for pollutant removal are described. The limitations of conventional adsorbent applications for water treatment are also discussed. Recently, nanotechnology has introduced nanoadsorbents, which have drawn additional attention due to their unique properties and are considered to be the viable alternative to conventional adsorbents. The potential applications, separation and regeneration of nanoadsorbents for wastewater treatment are also included in this review. Furthermore, prospects including commercial and health aspects of nanoadsorbents are also added."
Supramolecular assemblies mimicking neutrophil extracellular traps for MRSE infection control,"Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) stick to bacteria and prevent infections in vivo, whose activation is upon inflammatory stimuli along with the sudden increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nevertheless, the risky over activation in NETosis may result in deleterious outcome. A big challenge in using NETs for therapeutics is to synthesize an artificial system that can function as NETs in vivo. Here, we developed an in vivo supramolecular assembly system to imitate the innate immune process of NETs to inhibit methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) infection. Our synthesized small molecules undergo oxidation to form supramolecular nanofibers at inflammatory loci. The in situ formed nanofibers network efficiently traps MRSE cells and prevent them from aggressive dissemination. The extended interactions between nanofibers and bacteria directly result in the death of MRSE via the transcriptomes alterations. In clinically relevant models (intraperitoneal infection and catheter implantation), our supramolecular nets show significant antibacterial activity, yielding a three times efficacy comparing to vancomycin. The spontaneous consumption of ROS and the formation of antibacterial networks create a steady negative feedback system to combat bacterial infections."
The Known and Unknown about the Environmental Safety of Nanomaterials in Commerce,"The widespread nanomaterial use in commercial products has fed significant concern over environmental health and safety ramifications. Initially, little was known as to how these highly reactive particulates interacted with biological systems. Nanomaterials have introduced complexities not normally considered in traditional safety assessments of chemicals and therefore have generated uncertainty in the reliability of standard tests of safety. Advances in understanding the potential impacts of nanomaterials have occurred since their introduction, particularly for those used in the greatest quantities in commerce. The impact of characteristics such as charge, size, surface functionalization, chemical composition, and certain transformations on the potential effect of nanomaterials in the environment continue to move the field forward. However, generalizations of risk based on any one factor across nanomaterials is not possible. Estimating risk also remains difficult due to the introduction of materials that are new and more complex, minimal information on the specific molecular interactions of nanomaterials and organisms, and the need for more tools for measuring the dynamics of nanomaterial state and fate in complex matrices. Finally, exposure estimates are difficult due to difficulty of environmental monitoring which may be exacerbated by lack of information on nanomaterials in products and new uses in the marketplace."
Safety Considerations of Cancer Nanomedicine—A Key Step toward Translation,"The rate of translational effort of nanomedicine requires strategic planning of nanosafety research in order to enable clinical trials and safe use of nanomedicine in patients. Herein, the experiences that have emerged based on the safety data of classic liposomal formulations in the space of oncology are discussed, along with a description of the new challenges that need to be addressed according to the rapid expansion of nanomedicine platform beyond liposomes. It is valuable to consider the combined use of predictive toxicological assessment supported by deliberate investigation on aspects such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) and toxicokinetic profiles, the risk that may be introduced during nanomanufacture, unique nanomaterials properties, and nonobvious nanosafety endpoints, for example. These efforts will allow the generation of investigational new drug-enabling safety data that can be incorporated into a rational infrastructure for regulatory decision-making. Since the safety assessment relates to nanomaterials, the investigation should cover the important physicochemical properties of the material that may lead to hazards when the nanomedicine product is utilized in humans."
Human exposure to synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) is generally negligible as compared to natural compounds with higher or comparable endocrine activity. How to evaluate the risk of the S-EDCs?,"Theoretically, both synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) and natural (exogenous and endogenous) endocrine disrupting chemicals (N-EDCs) can interact with endocrine receptors and disturb hormonal balance. However, compared to endogenous hormones, S-EDCs are only weak partial agonists with receptor affinities several orders of magnitude lower. Thus, to elicit observable effects, S-EDCs require considerably higher concentrations to attain sufficient receptor occupancy or to displace natural hormones and other endogenous ligands. Significant exposures to exogenous N-EDCs may result from ingestion of foods such as soy-based diets, green tea and sweet mustard. While their potencies are lower as compared to natural endogenous hormones, they usually are considerably more potent than S-EDCs. Effects of exogenous N-EDCs on the endocrine system were observed at high dietary intakes. A causal relation between their mechanism of action and these effects is established and biologically plausible. In contrast, the assumption that the much lower human exposures to S-EDCs may induce observable endocrine effects is not plausible. Hence, it is not surprising that epidemiological studies searching for an association between S-EDC exposure and health effects have failed. Regarding testing for potential endocrine effects, a scientifically justified screen should use in vitro tests to compare potencies of S-EDCs with those of reference N-EDCs. When the potency of the S-EDC is similar or smaller than that of the N-EDC, further testing in laboratory animals and regulatory consequences are not warranted."
"Molecular Mechanisms, Characterization Methods, and Utilities of Nanoparticle Biotransformation in Nanosafety Assessments","It is a big challenge to reveal the intrinsic cause of a nanotoxic effect due to diverse branches of signaling pathways induced by engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). Biotransformation of toxic ENMs involving biochemical reactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and biological systems has recently attracted substantial attention as it is regarded as the upstream signal in nanotoxicology pathways, the molecular initiating event (MIE). Considering that different exposure routes of ENMs may lead to different interfaces for the arising of biotransformation, this work summarizes the nano–bio interfaces and dose calculation in inhalation, dermal, ingestion, and injection exposures to humans. Then, five types of biotransformation are shown, including aggregation and agglomeration, corona formation, decomposition, recrystallization, and redox reactions. Besides, the characterization methods for investigation of biotransformation as well as the safe design of ENMs to improve the sustainable development of nanotechnology are also discussed. Finally, future perspectives on the implications of biotransformation in clinical translation of nanomedicine and commercialization of nanoproducts are provided."
Understanding Nanomaterial Biotransformation: An Unmet Challenge to Achieving Predictive Nanotoxicology,"More than a decade has passed since the first concepts of predictive nanotoxicology were formulated. During this time, many advancements have been achieved in multiple disciplines, including the success stories of the fiber paradigm and the oxidative stress paradigm. However, important knowledge gaps are slowing down the development of predictive nanotoxicology and require a mutidisciplinary effort to be overcome. Among these gaps, understanding, reproducing, and modeling of nanomaterial biotransformation in biological environments is a central challenge, both in vitro and in silico. This dynamic and complex process is still a challenge for today's bioanalytics. This work explores and discusses selected approaches of the multidisciplinary efforts taken in the last decade and the challenges that remain unmet, in particular concerning nanomaterial biotransformation. It highlights some future advancements that, together, can help to understand such complex processes and accelerate the development of predictive nanotoxicology."
15 Years of Small: Research Trends in Nanosafety,"In the field of nano- and microscale science and technology, Small has become one of the worldwide leading journals since its initiation 15 years ago. Among all the topics covered in Small, “nanosafety” has received growing interest over the years, which accounts for a large proportion of the total publications of Small. Herein, inspired by its coming Special Issue “Rethinking Nanosafety,” a general bibliometric overview of the nanosafety studies that have been published in Small is presented. Using the data derived from the Web of Science Core Collection, the annual publication growth, most influential countries/institutions as well as the visualized collaborations between different countries and institutions based on CiteSpace software are presented. A special emphasis on the impact of the previous Special Issue from Small that is related to nanosafety research is given and the research trend from the most highly cited papers during last 15 years is analyzed. Lastly, future research directions are also proposed."
"Mechanistic Similarities between 3D Human Bronchial Epithelium and Mice Lung, Exposed to Copper Oxide Nanoparticles, Support Non-Animal Methods for Hazard Assessment","The diversity and increasing prevalence of products derived from engineered nanomaterials (ENM), warrants implementation of non-animal approaches to health hazard assessment for ethical and practical reasons. Although non-animal approaches are becoming increasingly popular, there are almost no studies of side-by-side comparisons with traditional in vivo assays. Here, transcriptomics is used to investigate mechanistic similarities between healthy/asthmatic models of 3D air–liquid interface (ALI) cultures of donor-derived human bronchial epithelia cells, and mouse lung tissue, following exposure to copper oxide ENM. Only 19% of mouse lung genes with human orthologues are not expressed in the human 3D ALI model. Despite differences in taxonomy and cellular complexity between the systems, a core subset of matching genes cluster mouse and human samples strictly based on ENM dose (exposure severity). Overlapping gene orthologue pairs are highly enriched for innate immune functions, suggesting an important and maybe underestimated role of epithelial cells. In conclusion, 3D ALI models based on epithelial cells, are primed to bridge the gap between traditional 2D in vitro assays and animal models of airway exposure, and transcriptomics appears to be a unifying dose metric that links in vivo and in vitro test systems."
Construction of Cu-bridged Cu<inf>2</inf>O/MIL(Fe/Cu) catalyst with enhanced interfacial contact for the synergistic photo-Fenton degradation of thiacloprid,"Cu2O/MIL(Fe/Cu) composite was fabricated via an in-situ Cu-bridging strategy to enhance interfacial synergistic effect of photo-Fenton catalysis for thiacloprid (TCL) degradation. Characterization results showed that: (1) Cu2O was proved to grow on the surface of MIL(Fe/Cu) in Cu2O/MIL(Fe/Cu) composite and display a high BET surface area of 1553 m2/g; (2) Cu2O/MIL(Fe/Cu) reduced band gap from 2.5 to 1.3 eV and extended absorption from UV to visible region; (3) Cu-bridge was proved to promote the intimate interface between Cu2O and MIL(Fe/Cu), which accelerated charge transferred and shortened the binding gap and the reaction pathway from photo-induced electrons to Fenton-generated radicals. As a result, this boosted the redox reaction of Fe2+/Fe3+ and promoted the reversible degree of this catalytic redox ability of MIL(Fe). Catalytic performance exhibited that (1) Cu2O/MIL(Fe/Cu) showed a fast kinetics (2–40 times faster than the state-of-the-art catalysts) and ultra-high mineralization (82.3% within 80 min) for TCL degradation; (2) Cu2O/MIL(Fe/Cu) showed a promising cycling stability due to improved charge transfer ability that could protect Cu2O from photo-corrosion during photo-Fenton reaction; (3) The catalytic performance of Cu2O/MIL(Fe/Cu) was characterized and seven photocatalytic intermediates were identified by both HPLC/MS and Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy. The cyanoimino group in TCL was proved for the first time to be attacked primarily. Moreover, among all the detected intermediates, thiazolidin-2-amine (P6) was found to be the most stable intermediate to be degraded, and it can directly influence the TOC determination during photodegradation process."
Stimuli-Responsive Small-on-Large Nanoradiosensitizer for Enhanced Tumor Penetration and Radiotherapy Sensitization,"Development of an efficient nanoradiosensitization system that enhances the radiation doses in cancer cells to sensitize radiotherapy (RT) while sparing normal tissues is highly desirable. Here, we construct a tumor microenvironment (TME)-responsive disassembled small-on-large molybdenum disulfide/hafnium dioxide (MoS2/HfO2) dextran (M/H-D) nanoradiosensitizer. The M/H-D can degrade and release the HfO2 nanoparticles (NPs) in TME to enhance tumor penetration of the HfO2 NPs upon near-infrared (NIR) exposure, which can solve the bottleneck of insufficient internalization of the HfO2 NPs. Simultaneously, the NIR photothermal therapy increased peroxidase-like catalytic efficiency of the M/H-D nanoradiosensitizer in TME, which selectively catalyzed intratumorally overexpressed H2O2 into highly oxidized hydroxyl radicals (·OH). The heat induced by PTT also relieved the intratumoral hypoxia to sensitize RT. Consequently, this TME-responsive precise nanoradiosensitization achieved improved irradiation effectiveness, potent oxygenation in tumor, and efficient suppression to tumor, which can be real-time monitored by computed tomography and photoacoustic imaging."
An MRI contrast agent based on a zwitterionic metal-chelating polymer for hepatorenal angiography and tumor imaging,"MRI contrast agents such as paramagnetic Gd(iii)-chelates, can improve the ability of MRI in differentiating diseased and healthy tissues, and have been widely used in clinical diagnosis. However, the enhancement effect of small molecular MRI contrast agents is unsatisfied due to their relative high rotation rates. Furthermore, the small molecular contrast agents also suffer from the short blood half-life and nonspecific extracellular diffusion in tissues, which also restricts their applications. To address these issues, we developed a macromolecular MRI contrast agent based on a zwitterionic metal-chelating polymer. Poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) was chosen as the main chain, and diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) as the metal-chelating group was coupled through the carboxyl groups of PAA using diethylenetriamine (DET) as a linker. The macromolecular MRI contrast agent constructed by chelating with Gd3+ (Gd-PAA) exhibited a much higher longitudinal relaxation rate (r1) than the clinical contrast agent Gd-DTPA. Importantly, due to the stealth ability of the zwitterionic structure, Gd-PAA can reside in the blood long enough without any microvascular leakage in the extracellular space of normal tissues, which allows it to be used for precise blood MR imaging, such as hepatorenal angiography, but also for tumor imaging because of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effecta. Besides, the result of long-term toxicity tests highlights the safety feature of the current contrast agent. Hence, the current contrast agent overcomes the defect of traditional small molecular Gd(iii)-based T1-weighted contrast agents and shows great prospects for future clinical applications.

Increasing the Assembly Efficacy of Peptidic β-Sheets for a Highly-Sensitive HIV Detection,"Our recent publication illustrates the critical role of phenylalanine-mediated aromatic-aromatic interactions in determining the assembly of peptidic β-sheets. However, the effect of phenylalanine number on regulating the assembly efficacy of peptidic β-sheets remains poorly understood. We herein evaluate the assembly efficacy of β-sheets of a series of oligopeptides which contain 0, 1, 2, or 3 phenylalanine in their molecular backbones. In our assembly system, two phenylalanine (2F) is the minimum number for driving the assembly of β-sheets of oligopeptides. Oligopeptides with three phenylalanine (3F) show significantly increased assembly efficacy of β-sheets compared to that with 2F. These results suggest a positive correlation between the phenylalanine number and assembly efficacy of β-sheets. By improving the assembly efficacy of β-sheets, we further develop a highly sensitive HIV analytical system in which the specific binding of β-sheets with Congo Red induces enhanced fluorescence. For HIV p24 detection, the 3F-based analytical system (0.61 pg/mL) shows a significantly lower limit of detection (LOD) than the 2F-based analytical system (2.44 pg/mL), both of which are more sensitive than commercial ELISA (5 pg/mL) used in the clinic. This work not only illustrates the effect of phenylalanine number on regulating the assembly efficacy of β-sheets but also provides a guideline for the construction of a highly sensitive analytical system of disease diagnosis."
Antimicrobial Gold Nanoclusters Eradicate Escherichia coli Biofilms and Are Nontoxic by Oral Administration,"Escherichia coli biofilms are a major causative agent of many intestinal infections, and there is ongoing research aimed at E. coli biofilm eradication. Gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) conjugated with various surface ligands have been extensively investigated for antimicrobial properties and provide a potential solution. There is little known about their in vivo safety because current standards of nanosafety research involve incubation of AuNCs with cells in vitro to confirm biocompatibility. In addition to systemic administration, nanosafety research on AuNC-based antimicrobials designed to treat gastrointestinal infections must also consider the potential for inducing gastrointestinal disorders. We report the design and application of two AuNCs coated with either hydroxyl (AuNC@PEG-OH)-or amine (AuNC@PEG-NH2)-functionalized poly(ethylene glycol), which enables the eradication of E. coli biofilms. Gastrointestinal safety of AuNC@PEG-OH and AuNC@PEG-NH2 was evaluated in healthy mice up to 35 days after administration by oral gavage at a dose of 10 mg/kg (or 1 mg/mL) daily for 14 days. No changes were detected in the histopathology of major organs, serum chemistry, hematology, and feces. Thus, oral administration of AuNCs is unlikely to be of concern for systemic toxicity or in the induction of gastrointestinal illnesses. Further studies on increasing time exposure and doses are necessary to determine whether toxicity occurs at higher doses or whether there is no adverse effect limit."
"Thermodynamic Parameters at Bio-Nano Interface and Nanomaterial Toxicity: A Case Study on BSA Interaction with ZnO, SiO<inf>2</inf>, and TiO<inf>2</inf>","Understanding nanomaterial (NM)-protein interactions is a key issue in defining the bioreactivity of NMs with great impact for nanosafety. In the present work, the complex phenomena occurring at the bio/nano interface were evaluated in a simple case study focusing on NM-protein binding thermodynamics and protein stability for three representative metal oxide NMs, namely, zinc oxide (ZnO; NM-110), titanium dioxide (TiO2; NM-101), and silica (SiO2; NM-203). The thermodynamic signature associated with the NM interaction with an abundant protein occurring in most cell culture media, bovine serum albumin (BSA), has been investigated by isothermal titration and differential scanning calorimetry. Circular dichroism spectroscopy offers additional information concerning adsorption-induced protein conformational changes. The BSA adsorption onto NMs is enthalpy-controlled, with the enthalpic character (favorable interaction) decreasing as follows: ZnO (NM-110) > SiO2 (NM-203) > TiO2 (NM-101). The binding of BSA is spontaneous, as revealed by the negative free energy, ΔG, for all systems. The structural stability of the protein decreased as follows: TiO2 (NM-101) > SiO2 (NM-203) > ZnO (NM-110). As protein binding may alter NM reactivity and thus the toxicity, we furthermore assessed its putative influence on DNA damage, as well as on the expression of target genes for cell death (RIPK1, FAS) and oxidative stress (SOD1, SOD2, CAT, GSTK1) in the A549 human alveolar basal epithelial cell line. The enthalpic component of the BSA-NM interaction, corroborated with BSA structural stability, matched the ranking for the biological alterations, i.e., DNA strand breaks, oxidized DNA lesions, cell-death, and antioxidant gene expression in A549 cells. The relative and total content of BSA in the protein corona was determined using mass-spectrometry-based proteomics. For the present case study, the thermodynamic parameters at bio/nano interface emerge as key descriptors for the dominant contributions determining the adsorption processes and NMs toxicological effect."
Liquid-Phase Exfoliation and Functionalization of MoS<inf>2</inf> Nanosheets for Effective Antibacterial Application,"A lysozyme (Lys)-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation technique was designed to synthesize MoS2 nanosheets (MoS2-Lys NSs). As a novel nanozyme antibacterial agent with high peroxidase-like catalyst activity, MoS2-Lys NSs showed good antibacterial efficacy against both Gram-negative ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli (Ampr E. coli) and Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis. A possible antibacterial mechanism is also proposed. This work provides an effective antibacterial strategy based on the MoS2-Lys NSs antibacterial agent."
Insights into the role of pyrrole doped in three-dimensional graphene aerogels for electrochemical sensing Cd(II),"In this work, three-dimensional graphene aerogels have been prepared by introduction of pyrrole to regulate their structure and properties and used as electrode materials to investigate the special role of pyrrole for sensing metal ions. The interaction between pyrrole and graphene oxide is explored through a series of characterization techniques to understand the role of doped pyrrole. Besides as N source to provide active metal ions binding sites, pyrrole can also serve as a reductant and a regulator to adjust the composition and structure of graphene aerogels, which greatly influences their electrochemical performance of sensing Cd(II). And, the reaction ratio of pyrrole and graphene oxide plays a key role to optimize the effect of pyrrole. By the method of square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV), the 3DGO-Py10 modified electrode can be successfully applied to determine Cd(II) in aqueous solutions. These findings will provide new guidelines to design electrode materials for heavy metal ions detection."
"High performance determination of Pb<sup>2+</sup> in water by 2,4-dithiobiuret-Reduced graphene oxide composite with wide linear range and low detection limit","In this work, a novel chelating adsorbent, 2, 4-dithiobiuret-reduced graphene oxide composite (DTB-RGO), was synthesized and worked as an electrochemical sensor for the determination of Pb2+. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy were used to confirm the successful doping of the aminothiourea groups into the GO nanosheets through amide bond. The electrode modified with DTB-RGO shows two wide linear range 0.1–200 ng mL−1, 200–1000 ng mL−1 and relatively low detection limit 0.08 ng mL−1 for Pb2+, far below the level of 10 ng mL−1 proposed by WHO. This DTB-RGO modified electrode also presents satisfying selectivity, reproducibility, stability, and applicability for detection of Pb2+, providing a simple and promising platform to develop novel electrochemical sensor for detecting Pb2+ with higher performance."
Semiconductor heterojunction-based radiocatalytic platforms for tumors treatment by enhancing radiation response and reducing radioresistance,"Radiotherapy is usually accompanied by side effects to healthy tissue and radiation resistance of tumor cells in clinical application. Therefore, how to enhance radiation effect and reduce radiation resistance is the key problem to enhance radiotherapy efficacy. In recent years, the development of nanomaterials with radiation catalysis function has provided us with opportunities. Here, we report a radiocatalytic platform using inorganic semiconductor nanoheterojunctions WO3@Ag2WO4@chitosan (WO3@Ag2WO4@CS) as radiation sensitizers to improve the radiotherapeutic effect of tumors by enhancing radiosensitization and reducing radioresistance. On one hand, WO3@Ag2WO4@CS with a higher atomic number has better X-ray absorptivity and can deposit a large amount of radiation dose upon X-ray irradiation. In addition, due to the heterojunction structure, a large number of electron-hole pairs can be generated and separated under X-ray trigger. The WO3@Ag2WO4@CS nanoheterojunctions thus can effectively decompose the surrounding hydrogen peroxide/water into free radicals to kill cancer cells by electron-hole pairs. On the other hand, WO3@Ag2WO4@CS nanoheterojunctions also have the ability to consume intracellular GSH through redox reaction, leading to increased ROS level and reduced radioresistance. Our study provides a novel nanoradiosensitizer that can improve the radiotherapeutic efficacy by enhancing the radiation response and reducing radioresistance of tumors."
Carbon nanotube filler enhances incinerated thermoplastics-induced cytotoxicity and metabolic disruption in vitro,"Background: Engineered nanomaterials are increasingly being incorporated into synthetic materials as fillers and additives. The potential pathological effects of end-of-lifecycle recycling and disposal of virgin and nano-enabled composites have not been adequately addressed, particularly following incineration. The current investigation aims to characterize the cytotoxicity of incinerated virgin thermoplastics vs. incinerated nano-enabled thermoplastic composites on two in vitro pulmonary models. Ultrafine particles released from thermally decomposed virgin polycarbonate or polyurethane, and their carbon nanotube (CNT)-enabled composites were collected and used for acute in vitro exposure to primary human small airway epithelial cell (pSAEC) and human bronchial epithelial cell (Beas-2B) models. Post-exposure, both cell lines were assessed for cytotoxicity, proliferative capacity, intracellular ROS generation, genotoxicity, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Results: The treated Beas-2B cells demonstrated significant dose-dependent cellular responses, as well as parent matrix-dependent and CNT-dependent sensitivity. Cytotoxicity, enhancement in reactive oxygen species, and dissipation of Δψm caused by incinerated polycarbonate were significantly more potent than polyurethane analogues, and CNT filler enhanced the cellular responses compared to the incinerated parent particles. Such effects observed in Beas-2B were generally higher in magnitude compared to pSAEC at treatments examined, which was likely attributable to differences in respective lung cell types. Conclusions: Whilst the effect of the treatments on the distal respiratory airway epithelia remains limited in interpretation, the current in vitro respiratory bronchial epithelia model demonstrated profound sensitivity to the test particles at depositional doses relevant for occupational cohorts."
Peptide-enabled receptor-binding-quantum dots for enhanced detection and migration inhibition of cancer cells,"We report the efforts to construct active targeting quantum dots using receptor-binding peptide for enhanced detection and migration inhibition of cancer cells. Peptide E5 has specific binding with chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), which is a transmembrane G-coupled receptor involved in the metastasis of various types of cancers. E5 was introduced to the surface of CdSe/ZnS quantum dots via biotin-streptavidin interactions. The constructed CXCR4-targeting quantum dots (E5@QDs) was observed to display improved detection sensitivity and significantly enhanced binding affinity for CXCR4 over-expressed cancer cells, and the ability to inhibit cancer cells migration induced by CXCL12."
A Novel CD133- and EpCAM-Targeted Liposome With Redox-Responsive Properties Capable of Synergistically Eliminating Liver Cancer Stem Cells,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a small subset of cells that sit atop the hierarchical ladder in many cancer types. Liver CSCs have been associated with high chemoresistance and recurrence rates in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, as of yet, no satisfactorily effective liver CSC-targeted treatment is available, which drove us to design and investigate the efficacy of a liposome-based delivery system. Here, we introduce a redox-triggered dual-targeted liposome, CEP-LP@S/D, capable of co-delivering doxorubicin (Dox) and salinomycin (Sal) for the synergistic treatment of liver cancer. This system is based on the association of CD133- and EpCAM-targeted peptides to form Y-shaped CEP ligands that were anchored to the surface of the liposome and allowed the selective targeting of CD133+ EpCAM+ liver CSCs. After arriving to the CSCs, the CEP-LP@S/D liposome undergoes endocytosis to the cytoplasm, where a high concentration of glutathione (GSH) breaks its disulfide bonds, thereby degrading the liposome. This then induces a rapid release of Dox and Sal to synergistically inhibit tumor growth. Notably, this effect occurs through Dox-induced apoptosis and concurrent lysosomal iron sequestration by Sal. Interestingly, both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that our GSH-responsive co-delivery system not only effectively enhanced CSC targeting but also eliminated the non-CSC faction, thereby exhibiting high antitumor efficacy. We believe that the smart liposome nanocarrier-based co-delivery system is a promising strategy to combat liver cancer, which may also lay the groundwork for more enhanced approaches to target other cancer types as well."
Enzyme-Triggered Disassembly of Perylene Monoimide-based Nanoclusters for Activatable and Deep Photodynamic Therapy,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) exhibits great potential for cancer therapy, but still suffers from nonspecific photosensitivity and poor penetration of photosensitizer. Herein, a smart perylene monoimide-based nanocluster capable of enzyme-triggered disassembly is reported as an activatable and deeply penetrable photosensitizer. A novel carboxylesterase (CE)-responsive tetrachloroperylene monoimide (P1) was synthesized and assembled with folate-decorated albumins into a nanocluster (FHP) with a diameter of circa 100 nm. Once P1 is hydrolyzed by the tumor-specific CE, FHP disassembles into ultrasmall nanoparticles (ca. 10 nm), facilitating the deep tumor penetration of FHP. Furthermore, such enzyme-triggered disassembly of FHP leads to enhanced fluorescence intensity (ca. 8-fold) and elevated singlet oxygen generation ability (ca. 4-fold), enabling in situ near-infrared fluorescence imaging and promoted PDT. FHP permits remarkable tumor inhibition in vivo with minimal side effects through imaging-guided, activatable, and deep PDT. This work confirms that this cascaded multifunctional control through enzyme-triggered molecular disassembly is an effective strategy for precise cancer theranostics."
Multi-walled carbon nanotubes induce IL-1β secretion by activating hemichannels-mediated ATP release in THP-1 macrophages,"Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are known to induce pulmonary inflammatory effects through stimulating pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion from alveolar macrophages. Despite extensive studies on MWCNTs’ pro-inflammatory reactivity, the understanding of molecular mechanisms involved is still incomplete. In this study, we investigated hemichannel’s involvement in MWCNTs-induced macrophage IL-1β release. Our results showed that the unmodified and COOH MWCNTs could induce ATP release and ATP-P2X7R axis-dependent IL-1β secretion from THP-1 macrophages. By using various inhibitors, we confirmed that the MWCNTs-induced ATP release was primarily through hemichannels. EtBr dye uptake assay detected significant hemichannels opening in MWCNTs exposed THP-1 macrophages. Inhibition of hemichannels by CBX, 43Gap27, or 10Panx1 pretreatment results in decreased ATP and IL-1β release. The addition of ATP restored the reduced IL-1β secretion level from hemichannel inhibition. We also confirmed with five other types of MWCNTs that the induction of hemichannels by MWCNTs strongly correlates with their capacity to induce IL-1β secretion. Taken together, we conclude that hemichannels-mediated ATP release and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome activation through P2X7R may be one mechanism by which MWCNTs induce macrophage IL-1β secretion. Our findings may provide a novel molecular mechanism for MWCNTs induced IL-1β secretion."
Optimizing bags of artificial neural networks for the prediction of viability from sparse data,"The prediction of organismal viability in response to exposure to different nanoparticles and conditions characterized at the molecular scale is challenging because several orders of magnitude must be bridged. A so-called bag of artificial neural networks has recently been shown to provide such a connection when trained through the use of relatively small databases. In the present work, we found that individual neural networks do not always converge under training. The use of bags and weighted means for consensus predictions provides a mechanism for effectively pruning the effects from the diverging networks without requiring prior conditioning. The optimized structure of these machines was also found to be effective in predicting the relative viability of nanoparticles that had not been used in developing the major findings of this work."
Simple spectroscopic determination of the hard protein corona composition in AuNPs: Albumin at 75%,"We analyzed the different spectroscopic profiles of nanoparticle hard protein corona formation using two model proteins, albumin and immunoglobulin. When compared to serum, this served for the analysis of the hard protein corona main components. To do that, we employed time-resolved UV-Visible light absorption spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and zeta potential measurements during nanoparticle-protein incubation. Under the tested experimental conditions, the expected evolution from a non-stable (soft) to a stable (hard) protein corona was confirmed for serum and albumin. At the same time, immunoglobulin incubation inevitably failed to form a corona and led to nanoparticle aggregation. The formation profiles of the protein corona were similar in the case of albumin and serum, indicating the dominance of albumin coating the nanoparticle surface when exposed to plasma. This was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Chemical digestion of the nanoparticles bearing different protein coronas gave indications of the density of the different protein coatings. Overall, this study of the protein corona by determining the adsorption kinetics finger-print enables the development of precise nanotechnologies avoiding cumbersome processes and delaying proteomics analysis.

Prodrug-Based Nanoreactors with Tumor-Specific in Situ Activation for Multisynergistic Cancer Therapy,"Efficient drug delivery into tumor cells while bypassing many biological barriers is still a challenge for cancer therapy. By taking advantage of the palladium (Pd)-mediated in situ activation of a prodrug and the glucose oxidase (GOD)-based β-d-glucose oxidation reaction, we developed a multisynergistic cancer therapeutic platform that combined doxorubicin (DOX)-induced chemotherapy with GOD-mediated cancer-orchestrated oxidation therapy and cancer starvation therapy. In the present work, we first synthesized DOX prodrugs (pDOXs) and temporarily assembled them with β-cyclodextrins to reduce their toxic side effects. Then, a nanoreactor was constructed by synthesizing Pd0 nanoparticles in situ within the pores of mesoporous silica nanoparticles for the conversion of pDOX into the active anticancer drug. Furthermore, GOD was introduced to decrease the pH of the tumor microenvironment and induce cancer-orchestrated oxidation/starvation therapy by catalyzing β-d-glucose oxidation to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and gluconic acid. Our study provides a new strategy that employs a cascade chemical reaction to achieve combined orchestrated oxidation/starvation/chemotherapy for the synergistic killing of cancer cells and the suppression of tumor growth."
Biological Safe Gold Nanoparticle-Modified Dental Aligner Prevents the Porphyromonas gingivalis Biofilm Formation,"Oral microbiology could directly influence overall health. Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is a highly pathogenic bacterium that causes periodontitis and other related systematic diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Orthodontic devices (e.g., invisalign aligner) is commonly used in populations with periodontitis who are also at a high risk of systematic diseases. In this study, newly explored antibacterial 4,6-diamino-2-pyrimidinethiol-modified gold nanoparticles (AuDAPT) were coated onto aligners. The coated aligners showed favorable antibacterial activity against P. gingivalis. In the presence of the coated aligner, the number of planktonic cells was decreased, and biofilm formation was prevented. This material also showed favorable biocompatibility in vivo and in vitro. This study reveals a new method for treating oral P. gingivalis by coating aligners with AuDAPT, which has typical advantages compared to other treatments for both periodontitis and related systematic diseases."
Measuring Enzymatic Activities with Nanopores,"Nanopores have become powerful and versatile tools for measuring single molecules since their emergence in the mid-1990s. They can be used to sense a wide variety of analytes including metal ions, small organic molecules, DNA/RNA, proteins, etc. to monitor chemical reactions, and to sequence DNA. Recently, enzymes have been studied by using nanopore technologies. In this Minireview, we highlight recent efforts in developing nanopore enzymology and categorize the related work into three groups: 1) measuring enzymatic activities with nanopore-enzyme hybrids; 2) measuring enzymatic activities through sensing their catalytic products with nanopores; 3) the use of enzymes for DNA sequencing and DNA/protein translocation. At the end, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in nanopore enzymology."
Efficient isolation and quantification of circulating tumor cells in non-small cell lung cancer patients using peptide-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles,"Background: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) carry a wealth of information on primary and metastatic tumors critical for enhancing the understanding of the occurrence, progression and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the low sensitivity of traditional tumor detection methods limits the application of CTCs in the treatment and disease surveillance of NSCLC. Therefore, CTCs isolation and detection with high sensitivity is highly desired especially for NSCLC patients, which is significant because of high occurrence and mortality. While it is very challenging because of the lower expression of CTC positive biomarkers such as epithelial cell adhesion molecules and cytokeratins (EpCAM and CKs), herein we report a method based on peptide-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles with high CTC capture efficiency, which demonstrates superiority in NSCLC clinical applications. Methods: For analysis and comparison of the peptide-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (TumorFisher, Nanopep Corp.) and the antibody-modified magnetic beads (CellSearch, Janssen Diagnostics, LLC), two NSCLC cell lines, A549 and NCI-H1975 were chosen to measure the binding affinity and capture efficiency. In order to compare the effect of the clinical application of these two detection systems, 7 early stage patients with NSCLC were enrolled in this study. To further explore the clinical utility of CTC counting in different stages, 81 NSCLC patients in stage I-IV were enrolled for CTC enumeration and statistical analysis. Results: The binding affinities of the recognition peptide to A549 and NCI-H1975 are 76.7%±11.0% and 70.1%±4.8%, respectively, which is similar with the positive control group (anti-EpCAM antibodies). CTCs were captured in 5/7 (71.4%) of early stage NSCLC patients with NSCLC in TumorFisher system, which is higher than CellSearch, and the false negative of TumorFisher is much lower than CellSearch. In a larger clinical cohort, the CTC numbers of NSCLC patients varied in different stages and the overall detection rate of TumorFisher was 59/81 (72.8%), with the similar proportion in stage I (21/29, 72.4%), II (17/22, 77.3%) and III (16/21, 76.2%). Conclusions: Highly efficient CTC isolation technique based on peptide-magnetic nanoparticles was firstly applied in NSCLC patients. Compared with the antibody-based the technique, the higher CTC detection rates (71.4%) in NSCLC patient blood samples were demonstrated for the patients in different stages, I-IV, especially in early stages. This indicates the feasibility of the clinical utility of this new technique in early stage screening, prognosis and therapy evaluation of NSCLC."
Assessment of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractants as biomarkers for prediction of pulmonary toxicity of nanomaterials,"This work determines whether cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractants (CINC)-1, CINC-2 and CINC-3 can be markers for predicting high or low pulmonary toxicity of nanomaterials (NMs). We classified NMs of nickel oxide (NiO) and cerium dioxide (CeO2) into high toxicity and NMs of two types of titanium dioxides (TiO2 (P90 and rutile)) and zinc oxide (ZnO) into low toxicity, and we analyzed previous data of CINCs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of rats from three days to six months after intratracheal instillation (0.2 and 1.0 mg) and inhalation exposure (0.32–10.4 mg/m3) of materials (NiO, CeO2, TiO2 (P90 and rutile), ZnO NMs and micron-particles of crystalline silica (SiO2)). The concentration of CINC-1 and CINC-2 in BALF had different increase tendency between high and low pulmonary toxicity of NMs and correlated with the other inflammatory markers in BALF. However, CINC-3 increased only slightly in a dose-dependent manner compared with CINC-1 and CINC-2. Analysis of receiver operating characteristics for the toxicity of NMs by CINC-1 and CINC-2 showed the most accuracy of discrimination of the toxicity at one week or one month after exposure and CINC-1 and CINC-2 in BALF following intratracheal instillation of SiO2 as a high toxicity could accurately predict the toxicity at more than one month after exposure. These data suggest that CINC-1 and CINC-2 may be useful biomarkers for the prediction of pulmonary toxicity of NMs relatively early in both intratracheal instillation and inhalation exposure."
Nanosilica-toughened epoxy resins,"Surface-modified silica nanoparticles are available as concentrates in epoxy resins in industrial quantities for nearly 20 years. Meanwhile, they are used in many epoxy resin formulations for various applications like fiber-reinforced composites, adhesives or electronic components; even in space vehicles like satellites. Some of the drawbacks of ""classic"" epoxy toughening using elastomers as a second phase, like lower modulus or a loss in strength can be compensated by using nanosilica together with such tougheners. Apparently, there exists a synergy as toughness and fatigue performance are increased significantly. This work intends to provide an overview regarding the possibilities of nanotoughening with silica, the industrial applications of such epoxy resin formulations and the most recent research results."
Bioinspired flexible electronics for seamless neural interfacing and chronic recording,"Implantable neural probes are among the most widely applied tools for the understanding of neural circuit functions and the treatment of neurological disorders. Despite remarkable progress in recent years, it is still challenging for conventional rigid probes to achieve stable neural recording over long periods of time. Recently, flexible electronics with biomimetic structures and mechanical properties have been demonstrated for the formation of seamless probe-neural interfaces, enabling long-term recording stability. In this review, we provide an overview of bioinspired flexible electronics, from their structural design to probe-brain interfaces and chronic neural recording applications. Opportunities of bioinspired flexible electronics in fundamental neuroscience and clinical studies are also discussed."
Molecular recognition of human islet amyloid polypeptide assembly by selective oligomerization of thioflavin T,"Selective oligomerization is a common phenomenon existing widely in the formation of intricate biological structures in nature. The precise design of drug molecules with an oligomerization state that specifically recognizes its receptor, however, remains substantially challenging. Here, we used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to identify the oligomerization states of an amyloid probe thioflavin T (ThT) on hIAPP8-37 assembly to be exclusively even numbers. We demonstrate that both adhesive interactions between ThT and the protein substrate and cohesive interactions among ThT molecules govern the oligomerization state of the bounded ThT. Specifically, the work of the cohesive interaction between two head/tail ThTs is determined to be 6.4 kBT, around 50% larger than that of the cohesive interaction between two side-by-side ThTs (4.2 kBT). Overall, our STM imaging and theoretical understanding at the single-molecule level provide valuable insights into the design of drug compounds using the selective oligomerization of molecular probes to recognize protein self-assembly."
"Polymeric Nanoparticles: Production, Characterization, Toxicology and Ecotoxicology","Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) are particles within the size range from 1 to 1000 nm and can be loaded with active compounds entrapped within or surface-adsorbed onto the polymeric core. The term “nanoparticle” stands for both nanocapsules and nanospheres, which are distinguished by the morphological structure. Polymeric NPs have shown great potential for targeted delivery of drugs for the treatment of several diseases. In this review, we discuss the most commonly used methods for the production and characterization of polymeric NPs, the association efficiency of the active compound to the polymeric core, and the in vitro release mechanisms. As the safety of nanoparticles is a high priority, we also discuss the toxicology and ecotoxicology of nanoparticles to humans and to the environment."
An in vitro lung system to assess the proinflammatory hazard of carbon nanotube aerosols,"In vitro three-dimensional (3D) lung cell models have been thoroughly investigated in recent years and provide a reliable tool to assess the hazard associated with nanomaterials (NMs) released into the air. In this study, a 3D lung co-culture model was optimized to assess the hazard potential of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), which is known to provoke inflammation and fibrosis, critical adverse outcomes linked to acute and prolonged NM exposure. The lung co-cultures were exposed to MWCNTs at the air-liquid interface (ALI) using the VITROCELL® Cloud system while considering realistic occupational exposure doses. The co-culture model was composed of three human cell lines: alveolar epithelial cells (A549), fibroblasts (MRC-5), and macrophages (differentiated THP-1). The model was exposed to two types of MWCNTs (Mitsui-7 and Nanocyl) at different concentrations (2–10 µg/cm2) to assess the proinflammatory as well as the profibrotic responses after acute (24 h, one exposure) and prolonged (96 h, repeated exposures) exposure cycles. The results showed that acute or prolonged exposure to different concentrations of the tested MWCNTs did not induce cytotoxicity or apparent profibrotic response; however, suggested the onset of proinflammatory response."
Dissolution behavior of metal oxide nanomaterials in cell culture medium versus distilled water,"Solubility is a key criterion used in the hazard assessment of metal oxide–engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). The present study investigated solubility of CuO, NiO, and TiO2 ENMs compared with their bulk analogues in two aqueous media: water and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM). Particle size distributions were characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS). After centrifugal separation, the dissolved metal fraction was quantified using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Overall, solubility of the metal oxides decreased in the order CuO ≥ NiO > TiO2 in both media, with each ENM displaying higher solubility than its bulk analogue. However, the metal oxide ENMs responded differently to the two aqueous media, when comparing their solubility using a low initial concentration (10 mg/L) versus a high initial concentration (100 mg/L). In DMEM, both nano-CuO and nano-NiO displayed increased solubility at the higher initial concentration by 3.8-fold and 1.4-fold, respectively. In water, this trend was reversed, with both nano-CuO and nano-NiO displaying increased solubility at the lower initial concentration by 3.3-fold and 1.2-fold, respectively. Interestingly, solubility trends displayed by nano-TiO2 were the opposite of those displayed by nano-CuO and nano-NiO. In DMEM, nano-TiO2 displayed decreased solubility at the higher initial concentration (0.3-fold), whereas in water, nano-TiO2 displayed increased solubility at the higher initial concentration (5.5-fold). These results show the importance of evaluating the solubility of ENMs in biologically relevant fluids at concentrations that correspond to toxicity assays, for the purposes of read-across and grouping ENMs."
Improving quality in nanoparticle-induced cytotoxicity testing by a tiered inter-laboratory comparison study,"The quality and relevance of nanosafety studies constitute major challenges to ensure their key role as a supporting tool in sustainable innovation, and subsequent competitive economic advantage. However, the number of apparently contradictory and inconclusive research results has increased in the past few years, indicating the need to introduce harmonized protocols and good practices in the nanosafety research community. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate if best-practice training and inter-laboratory comparison (ILC) of performance of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay for the cytotoxicity assessment of nanomaterials among 15 European laboratories can improve quality in nanosafety testing. We used two well-described model nanoparticles, 40-nm carboxylated polystyrene (PS-COOH) and 50-nm amino-modified polystyrene (PS-NH2). We followed a tiered approach using well-developed standard operating procedures (SOPs) and sharing the same cells, serum and nanoparticles. We started with determination of the cell growth rate (tier 1), followed by a method transfer phase, in which all laboratories performed the first ILC on the MTS assay (tier 2). Based on the outcome of tier 2 and a survey of laboratory practices, specific training was organized, and the MTS assay SOP was refined. This led to largely improved intra-and inter-laboratory reproducibility in tier 3. In addition, we confirmed that PS-COOH and PS-NH2 are suitable negative and positive control nanoparticles, respectively, to evaluate impact of nanomaterials on cell viability using the MTS assay. Overall, we have demonstrated that the tiered process followed here, with the use of SOPs and representative control nanomaterials, is necessary and makes it possible to achieve good inter-laboratory reproducibility, and therefore high-quality nanotoxicological data."
Synthetic CXCR4 Antagonistic Peptide Assembling with Nanoscaled Micelles Combat Acute Myeloid Leukemia,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common adult acute leukemia with very low survival rate due to drug resistance and high relapse rate. The C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is highly expressed by AML cells, actively mediating chemoresistance and reoccurrence. Herein, a chemically synthesized CXCR4 antagonistic peptide E5 is fabricated to micelle formulation (M-E5) and applied to refractory AML mice, and its therapeutic effects and pharmacokinetics are investigated. Results show that M-E5 can effectively block the surface CXCR4 in leukemic cells separated from bone marrow (BM) and spleen, and inhibit the C-X-C chemokine ligand 12-mediated migration. Subcutaneous administration of M-E5 significantly inhibits the engraftment of leukemic cells in spleen and BM, and mobilizes residue leukemic cells into peripheral blood, reducing organs’ burden and significantly prolonging the survival of AML mice. M-E5 can also increase the efficacy of combining regime of homoharringtonine and doxorubicin. Ribonucleic acid sequencing demonstrates that the therapeutic effect is contributed by inhibiting proliferation and enhancing apoptosis and differentiation, all related to the CXCR4 signaling blockade. M-E5 reaches the concentration peak at 2 h after administration with a half-life of 14.5 h in blood. In conclusion, M-E5 is a novel promising therapeutic candidate for refractory AML treatment."
A Graphdiyne Oxide-Based Iron Sponge with Photothermally Enhanced Tumor-Specific Fenton Chemistry,"Fenton reaction-mediated oncotherapy is an emerging strategy which uses iron ions to catalytically convert endogenous hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals, the most reactive oxygen species found in biology, for efficient cancer therapy. However, Fenton reaction efficiency in tumor tissue is typically limited due to restrictive conditions. One strategy to overcome this obstacle is to increase the temperature specifically at the tumor site. Herein, a tumor-targeting iron sponge (TTIS) nanocomposite based on graphdiyne oxide, which has a high affinity for iron is described. TTIS can accumulate in tumor tissue by decoration with a tumor-targeting polymer to enable tumor photoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging. With its excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (37.5%), TTIS is an efficient photothermal therapy (PTT) agent. Moreover, the heat produced in the process of PTT can accelerate the release of iron ions from TTIS and simultaneously enhance the efficiency of the Fenton reaction, thus achieving a combined PTT and Fenton reaction-mediated cancer therapy. This work introduces a graphdiyne oxide-based iron sponge that exerts an enhanced antitumor effect through PTT and Fenton chemistry."
Multiscale Analysis of Metal Oxide Nanoparticles in Tissue: Insights into Biodistribution and Biotransformation,"Metal oxide nanoparticles have emerged as exceptionally potent biomedical sensors and actuators due to their unique physicochemical features. Despite fascinating achievements, the current limited understanding of the molecular interplay between nanoparticles and the surrounding tissue remains a major obstacle in the rationalized development of nanomedicines, which is reflected in their poor clinical approval rate. This work reports on the nanoscopic characterization of inorganic nanoparticles in tissue by the example of complex metal oxide nanoparticle hybrids consisting of crystalline cerium oxide and the biodegradable ceramic bioglass. A validated analytical method based on semiquantitative X-ray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma spectrometry is used to assess nanoparticle biodistribution following intravenous and topical application. Then, a correlative multiscale analytical cascade based on a combination of microscopy and spectroscopy techniques shows that the topically applied hybrid nanoparticles remain at the initial site and are preferentially taken up into macrophages, form apatite on their surface, and lead to increased accumulation of lipids in their surroundings. Taken together, this work displays how modern analytical techniques can be harnessed to gain unprecedented insights into the biodistribution and biotransformation of complex inorganic nanoparticles. Such nanoscopic characterization is imperative for the rationalized engineering of safe and efficacious nanoparticle-based systems."
Comparison of species sensitivity distribution modeling approaches for environmental risk assessment of nanomaterials – A case study for silver and titanium dioxide representative materials,"Species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) are used in chemical safety assessments to derive predicted-no-effect-concentrations (PNECs) for substances with a sufficient amount of relevant and reliable ecotoxicity data available. For engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), ecotoxicity data are often compromised by poor reproducibility and the lack of nano-specific characterization needed describe an ENM under test exposure conditions. This may influence the outcome of SSD modelling and hence the regulatory decision-making. This study investigates how the outcome of SSD modelling is influenced by: 1) Selecting input data based on the nano-specific “nanoCRED” reliability criteria, 2) Direct SSD modelling avoiding extrapolation of data by including long-term/chronic NOECs only, and 3) Weighting data according to their nano-specific quality, the number of data available for each species, and the trophic level abundance in the ecosystem. Endpoints from freshwater ecotoxicity studies were collected for the representative nanomaterials NM-300 K (silver) and NM-105 (titanium dioxide), evaluated for regulatory reliability and scored according to the level of nano-specific characterization conducted. The compiled datasets are unique in exclusively dealing with representative ENMs showing minimal batch-to-batch variation. The majority of studies were evaluated as regulatory reliable, while the degree of nano-specific characterization varied greatly. The datasets for NM-300 K and NM-105 were used as input to the nano-weighted n-SSWD model, the probabilistic PSSD+, and the conventional SSD Generator by the US EPA. The conventional SSD generally yielded the most conservative, but least precise HC5 values, with 95 % confidence intervals up to 100-fold wider than the other models. The inclusion of regulatory reliable data only, had little effect on the HC5 generated by the conventional SSD and the PSSD+, whereas the n-SSWD estimated different HC5 values based on data segregated according to reliability, especially for NM-105. The n-SSWD weighting of data significantly affected the estimated HC5 values, however in different ways for the sub-datasets of NM-300 K and NM-105. For NM-300 K, the inclusion of NOECs only in the weighted n-SSWD yielded the most conservative HC5 of all datasets and models (a HC5 based on NOECs only could not be estimated for NM-105, due to limited number of data). Overall, the estimated HC5 values of all models are within a relatively limited concentration range of 25−100 ng Ag/L for NM-300 K and 1−15 μgTiO2/L for NM-105."
"Rapid Fabrication of Self-Healing, Conductive, and Injectable Gel as Dressings for Healing Wounds in Stretchable Parts of the Body","Skin wounds on stretchable parts of the body including the elbows, knees, wrists, and nape usually undergo delayed and poor healing due to the interference of their frequent motion. Ordinary dressings that are not flexible enough face difficulty to promote wound healing due to the mismatching between the mechanics of the dressing materials and the wounds. In this study, an injectable, biocompatible, self-healable, and conductive material poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate)/guar slime (PPGS) is developed for healing wounds with various kinds of movements. As a proof-of-principle assay, the healing effect of PPGS is explored on a skin wound model on the nape of rats that often experiences frequent movements. PPGS, which can be prepared within 1 min, successfully accelerates the healing of the wounds. The results suggest that PPGS has great potential in the fields of tissue engineering and biomedicine."
Human exposure to synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) is generally negligible as compared to natural compounds with higher or comparable endocrine activity. How to evaluate the risk of the S-EDCs?,"Theoretically, both synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) and natural (exogenous and endogenous) endocrine disrupting chemicals (N-EDCs) can interact with endocrine receptors and disturb hormonal balance. However, compared to endogenous hormones, S-EDCs are only weak partial agonists with receptor affinities several orders of magnitude lower. Thus, to elicit observable effects, S-EDCs require considerably higher concentrations to attain sufficient receptor occupancy or to displace natural hormones and other endogenous ligands. Significant exposures to exogenous N-EDCs may result from ingestion of foods such as soy-based diets, green tea and sweet mustard. While their potencies are lower as compared to natural endogenous hormones, they usually are considerably more potent than S-EDCs. Effects of exogenous N-EDCs on the endocrine system were observed at high dietary intakes. A causal relation between their mechanism of action and these effects is established and biologically plausible. In contrast, the assumption that the much lower human exposures to S-EDCs may induce observable endocrine effects is not plausible. Hence, it is not surprising that epidemiological studies searching for an association between S-EDC exposure and health effects have failed. Regarding testing for potential endocrine effects, a scientifically justified screen should use in vitro tests to compare potencies of S-EDCs with those of reference N-EDCs. When the potency of the S-EDC is similar or smaller than that of the N-EDC, further testing in laboratory animals and regulatory consequences are not warranted."
Nano-bio interactions: the implication of size-dependent biological effects of nanomaterials,"Due to their many advantageous properties, nanomaterials (NMs) have been utilized in diverse consumer goods, industrial products, and for therapeutic purposes. This situation leads to a constant risk of exposure and uptake by the human body, which are highly dependent on nanomaterial size. Consequently, an improved understanding of the interactions between different sizes of nanomaterials and biological systems is needed to design safer and more clinically relevant nano systems. We discuss the sizedependent effects of nanomaterials in living organisms. Upon entry into biological systems, nanomaterials can translocate biological barriers, distribute to various tissues and elicit different toxic effects on organs, based on their size and location. The association of nanomaterial size with physiological structures within organs determines the site of accumulation of nanoparticles. In general, nanomaterials smaller than 20 nm tend to accumulate in the kidney while nanomaterials between 20 and 100 nm preferentially deposit in the liver. After accumulating in organs, nanomaterials can induce inflammation, damage structural integrity and ultimately result in organ dysfunction, which helps better understand the size-dependent dynamic processes and toxicity of nanomaterials in organisms. The enhanced permeability and retention effect of nanomaterials and the utility of this phenomenon in tumor therapy are also highlighted."
Metal-derived nanoparticles in tumor theranostics: Potential and limitations,"Initially, metal derived nanoparticles have been used exclusively as contrasting agents in magnetic resonance imaging. Today, green routes of chemical synthesis together with numerous modifications of the core and surface gave rise to a plethora of biomedical applications of metal derived nanoparticles including tumor imaging, diagnostics, and therapy. These materials are an emerging class of tools for tumor theranostics. Nevertheless, the spectrum of clinically approved metal nanoparticles remains narrow, as the safety, specificity and efficiency still have to be improved. In this review we summarize the major directions for development and biomedical applications of metal based nanoparticles and analyze their effects on tumor cells and microenvironment. We discuss the advantages and possible limitations of metal nanoparticle-based tumor theranostics, as well as the potential strategies to improve the in vivo performance of these unique materials."
Removal of boron from water by GO/ZIF-67 hybrid material adsorption,"With the development of the boron industry, boron pollution is getting more and more serious, and excessive boron will harm human health. In this paper, graphene oxide was used as a template to prepare ZIF-67, and GO/ZIF-67 was successfully prepared. GO/ZIF-67 was used for the first time to remove boron from water. SEM, XRD, and other characterization methods were used to confirm the structure. The adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherm, adsorption thermodynamics, and adsorption mechanism of boron by GO/ZIF-67 were studied in this paper. The adsorption capacity of GO/ZIF-67 for boron is up to 66.65 mg·g−1 at 25 °C, and adsorption process reaches equilibrium in 400 min. Adsorption kinetics indicates that the adsorption process conforms to the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, and adsorption thermodynamics indicates that the adsorption process is a spontaneous endothermic process controlled by entropy change. The adsorption capacity of boron by GO/ZIF-67 does not decrease significantly after four cycles. The adsorption of boron by GO/ZIF-67 has both chemical and physical adsorption. From Zeta potential and adsorption kinetics, it can be seen that there is physical adsorption during the adsorption process and boron mainly has positive charge on the surface of GO/ZIF-67 and graphene oxide hydroxyl bonding. Based on the adsorption thermodynamics and XPS, it is known that there is chemisorption during the adsorption process, and mainly the combination of boron and cobalt sites."

Trap and kill strategy for non-BRCA mutant pancreatic cancer by co-delivery of olaparib and JQ1 with plectin-1 targeting peptide nanoparticles,"The poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib (Ola), which inhibits the repair of DNA single-strand breaks, has been approved recently by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of U.S. for treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer patients with BRCA (Breast Cancer) mutations. However, the response of the pancreatic cancer patients with non-BRCA mutant to Ola treatment remains suboptimal. There is an urgent need to develop effective therapeutic solutions for the majority pancreatic patients. Recently, the drug combination of Ola and the homologous recombination inhibitor JQ1 to treat non-BRCA mutant pancreatic cancers has showed promising outcomes. Herein, we took the advantage of peptide nanoparticle platform, which possesses high drug loading capacity, desirable pharmacokinetic profiles and integration of peptide targeting motif, and developed a tailor-designed plectin-1 targeting peptide nanoparticles (PTNPs) for co-delivery of Ola and JQ1 to treat non-BRCA mutant pancreatic cancers. We confirmed that the majority pancreatic tumor cells are plectin-1 positive. The PTNPs efficiently targeted plectin-1 positive pancreatic tumor cells in vitro and significantly accumulated in tumor site in vivo. The targeted co-delivery of Ola and JQ1 induced much more pancreatic tumor cell apoptosis and significantly enhanced the synergistic effect of combination treatment of Ola and JQ1 in both orthotopic and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Furthermore, this precise delivery of highly coordinated drugs to tumor cells distinctly reduced adverse effects caused by combination of Ola and JQ1."
Self-assembly of pentapeptides into morphology-adaptable nanomedicines for enhanced combinatorial chemo-photodynamic therapy,"The persistent morphology of conventional delivering systems limits their capability to further simultaneously optimize pharmokinetics and overcome the physiological delivering barriers. To address this challenge, here we report nanomedicines delivered by morphology-adaptable platforms for enhanced drug delivering and combinatorial chemo-photodynamic therapeutic efficacy. The nanomedicines were created by co-assembling a pentapeptide (AmpF) containing a 4-amino proline (Amp) with its two derivatives CPT-AmpF and IR820-AmpF, which are functionalized by drug camptothecin (CPT) and photosensitizer new indocyanine green IR820, respectively. The resulting nanomedicines formed superhelices and nanoparticles under neutral and mild acidic pH conditions. Cellular experiments revealed that the nanomedicines were up-taken by breast cancer cells via an endo-/lysosome-mediated mechanism, thus allowing the nanomedicines to undergo a reversible superhelice-nanoparticle morphological transition during the delivering pathway. Therefore, the superhelcial morphology of the nanomedicines prolonged blood circulation and tumor retention, whereas the transformed nanoparticles facilitated penetration and accumulation at tumor sites. Compared to the morphology-persistent counterparts, the improved delivering efficiency of the adaptable nanomedicines resulted in the enhanced combinatorial chemo-photodynamic therapy against breast tumors, thus potentially leading to a facile and versatile strategy for drug delivery and paving the way toward new-generation nanomedicines in the future."

Cell-Penetrating Peptides and Polymers for Improved Drug Delivery,"Effective delivery of biologically active compounds including peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids into cells is an obstacle in the drug research. The intracellular delivery of biological agents generally relies on the endocytosis pathway, causing them to be trapped in endosomes and lysosomes. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have previously been shown to be a useful transport tool for delivering many kinds of goods into cells through cell membranes. The latest discovery of cell penetrating poly(disulfide)s (CPDs) with excellent cytosolic delivery efficiency represents a major breakthrough in this field. In this work, we will focus on the latest advances in biological applications of the CPPs and new opportunities opened up by the CPDs."
Regulating Risk of Nanomaterials for Workers through Soft Law Approach,"Nanotechnology has revolutionized various industries and has become a notable catalyst for economic growth. The emerging issues of human health and safety associated with nanotechnology development have raised regulatory concerns worldwide. In occupational settings, the same novel characteristics of nanomaterials that are utilized for innovation may also be the source of toxins with adverse health effects for workers. The existing regulatory framework may function effectively to regulate chemical substances in their conventional forms but may not be adequate with regard to the specific issues of nanoform substances. A foundation of knowledge concerning properties of nanomaterials, and risk management approaches for these materials have been established, but conclusive results remain elusive. It is difficult for lawmakers to regulate nanotechnology-related activities effectively if conventional regulatory mechanisms are applied. The present article analyses in a country study the adequacy of existing Malaysian occupational safety and health law with regard to the specific issues presented by nanotechnology. The applicable regulatory approaches are examined to justify the adoption of soft law instruments as regulatory mechanisms for nanotechnology. A number of soft law best practices are briefly discussed as a basis to recommend practical solutions to close the existing regulatory gap."
Blueprint for the Development and Sustainability of National Nanosafety Centers,"This work presents a blueprint or set of guidelines for the planning and development of sustainable national centers dealing with the safety of nanomaterials and nanotechnologies toward public health and environment. The blueprint was developed following a methodological approach of EU-wide online survey and workshop with several stakeholders. The purpose was to identify the key elements and challenges in the development and sustainability of a national nanosafety center. The responses were received from representatives of 16 national nanosafety centers across Europe and 44 people from 18 EU member states who represented the stakeholder groups of researchers, academics, industry, regulators, civil society, and consultants. By providing an overview of the organizational design of existing national nanosafety centers across EU and converging demands in the field of nanosafety, the blueprint principally benefits those EU member states who do not have a national nanosafety center, but intend to develop an entity to manage the human health, environmental, ethical, and social concerns/risks toward the growing nationwide activities on engineered nanomaterials, e.g., their production, use or disposal, at national level."
Mammalian Pericardium-Based Bioprosthetic Materials in Xenotransplantation and Tissue Engineering,"Bioprosthetic materials based on mammalian pericardium tissue are the gold standard in reconstructive surgery. Their application range covers repair of rectovaginal septum defects, abdominoplastics, urethroplasty, duraplastics, maxillofacial, ophthalmic, thoracic and cardiovascular reconstruction, etc. However, a number of factors contribute to the success of their integration into the host tissue including structural organization, mechanical strength, biocompatibility, immunogenicity, surface chemistry, and biodegradability. In order to improve the material's properties, various strategies are developed, such as decellularization, crosslinking, and detoxification. In this review, the existing issues and long-term achievements in the development of bioprosthetic materials based on the mammalian pericardium tissue, aimed at a wide-spectrum application in reconstructive surgery are analyzed. The basic technical approaches to preparation of biocompatible forms providing continuous functioning, optimization of biomechanical and functional properties, and clinical applicability are described."
Optical Characterization and Monitoring of Enzyme Catalyzed Short Chain Peptides in Cellular Environment,"Abstract: Enzyme catalysis is an emerging technique that has been employed to identify the protein of interest in a complex cellular environment. In present article, we have utilized optical techniques for the identification of enzyme mediated catalysis of fusion protein to study the short chain amino acid epitope in both aqueous solution and cellular environment. We characterized enzyme catalysis short chain peptide with electron microscopic techniques, for the study of reaction product and its morphology in aqueous solution. Furthermore, we applied MALDI-TOF-MS technique for the analysis of fusion protein, FLAG-tag peptides and enterokinase enzyme (EK), in complex solutions and cellular environment. The enzyme catalytic reactions were studied HEK-293T cells with confocal fluorescence microscopy. In spectroscopic studies two sharp prominent peaks at 310 nm and 330 nm were appeared in case of Flag-tag peptide and for fusion protein absorption peaks were found at 315 nm and 410 nm with relative increase in intensity level. Furthermore, a linear relation between response unit and binding time (ms) for both fusion protein and EK was observed. Mass spectra reveal the presence of FLAG-tag peptide epitope at mass to charge (m/z) ratio of 2190.023 and 2191.102 in cell lysation with and without enterokinase respectively. We provide here a rapid and accurate trace detection system for enzyme cleaved peptides in fusion protein by taking a snapshot of peptide to identify specific domains based on amino acids and their mass spectrum calculations.

Complement Inhibitors Block Complement C3 Opsonization and Improve Targeting Selectivity of Nanoparticles in Blood,"Complement is one of the critical branches of innate immunity that determines the recognition of engineered nanoparticles by immune cells. Antibody-targeted iron oxide nanoparticles are a popular platform for magnetic separations, in vitro diagnostics, and molecular imaging. We used 60 nm cross-linked iron oxide nanoworms (CLIO NWs) modified with antibodies against Her2/neu and EpCAM, which are common markers of blood-borne cancer cells, to understand the role of complement in the selectivity of targeting of tumor cells in whole blood. CLIO NWs showed highly efficient targeting and magnetic isolation of tumor cells spiked in lepirudin-anticoagulated blood, but specificity was low due to high uptake by neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. Complement C3 opsonization in plasma was predominantly via the alternative pathway regardless of the presence of antibody, PEG, or fluorescent tag, but was higher for antibody-conjugated CLIO NWs. Addition of various soluble inhibitors of complement convertase (compstatin, soluble CD35, and soluble CD55) to whole human blood blocked up to 99% of the uptake of targeted CLIO NWs by leukocytes, which resulted in a more selective magnetic isolation of tumor cells. Using well-characterized nanomaterials, we demonstrate here that complement therapeutics can be used to improve targeting selectivity."
Hybrid membrane camouflaged copper sulfide nanoparticles for photothermal-chemotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Biomimetic nanoparticles (NPs) coated with cell membranes show enhanced biocompatibility and specificity for homotypic cells, and have gained considerable attention for targeted anti-tumor therapy. We constructed cancer cell-macrophage hybrid membrane-coated near infrared (NIR)-responsive hollow copper sulfide nanoparticles encapsulating sorafenib and surface modified with anti-VEGFR (CuS-SF@CMV NPs). These CuS-SF@CMV NPs expressed the characteristic membrane proteins of both cancer cells and macrophages, and selectively accumulated in cancer cells in vitro and tumors in vivo, compared to the CuS NPs. In addition, the CuS-SF@CMV NPs achieved synergistic photo-thermal and chemotherapy in cancer cells upon NIR irradiation, with 94.3% inhibition of tumor growth in a murine hepatoma model. While the initial increase in temperature rapidly killed the tumor cells, sorafenib and the anti-VEGFR antibody sustained the tumor killing effect by respectively inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis via the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. Taken together, the CuS-SF@CMV NPs have immune evasion, tumor cell targeting and drug loading capacities, along with an inherent photo-thermal conversion ability, making them ideal for synergistic photo-thermal/chemo therapy against HCC. Statement of Significance: We created cancer cell-macrophage hybrid membrane-coated hollow CuS NPs encapsulating sorafenib and surface modified with anti-VEGFR antibodies (CuS-SF@CMV). These CuS-SF@CMV NPs enhanced synergistic PTT and chemotherapy against hepatoma cells through homotypic cell targeting, immune escape and inhibition of a tumorigenic signaling pathway. A long-term inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis was achieved owing to the rapid destruction of the cancer cells through photo-thermal conversion by the CuS NPs, and sustained clearance of the tumor cells by sorafenib and anti-VEGFR antibodies. Our findings suggest that CuS-SF@CMV NPs present great treating effects in preclinical models of HCC, providing the framework for further study in clinical trials to improve patient outcome in hepatocellular carcinoma."
Structure optimization of CH<inf>3</inf>NH<inf>3</inf>PbI<inf>3</inf> by higher-valence Pb in perovskite solar cells with enhanced efficiency and stability,"The crystal structure of perovskite has a significant influence on the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Pb4+ is introduced into CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3)-based PSCs by participating the octahedral [PbI6]4- structure, then to induce the formation of stronger Pb-I bond and reduce [PbI6]4- octahedron distortion, which would improve structural symmetry, decrease the degree of disorder and be beneficial to the crystallization of perovskites. Synchrotron based X-ray absorption fine spectroscope (XAFS) revealed that the existence of higher valence state lead could be realized by doping Pb4+ directly or induced by electron withdrawing group, in consequence the [PbI6]4- octahedral structure becomes more stable. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) especially demonstrates that Pb4+ with appropriate proportion may well replace part of Pb2+ to form an uniform phase in the primal perovskite structure to improve the crystallization on the surface and homogeneous out-of-plane (OOP) ordered crystal accumulation in the bulk, which is also important for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs. As a result, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exhibits a 42.1% increase with the doping of 0.03% PbF4 and 0.075% PCBM compared with a pristine device and its stability improves markedly after 30 days of storage in ambient atmosphere."
The Density of Surface Coating Can Contribute to Different Antibacterial Activities of Gold Nanoparticles,"With the widespread use of antibiotics, the number of complex infection cases caused by unknown pathogens is increasing and novel antibiotics with tunable antibacterial spectra and low toxicity are highly desirable. Herein, we report that, by selecting thiol or amine, two groups with different binding affinities with gold, as anchoring groups, phenylboronic acid can be decorated on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with different densities, which contributes to Gram-selective antibacterial activities of the AuNPs. The AuNPs modified with amine- or thiol-tethered phenylboronic acids specifically bind to lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Gram-negative) or lipoteichoic acid (LTA, Gram-positive), respectively. By modifying AuNPs with different ratios of thiol- and amine-tethered phenylboronic acids, the resulting AuNPs show potent and tunable antibacterial activity. The AuNP-based antibacterial agents with optional Gram selectivity are promising for applications in personalized therapy."
Dually Enzyme- And Acid-Triggered Self-Immolative Ketal Glycoside Nanoparticles for Effective Cancer Prodrug Monotherapy,"The use of glycoside prodrugs is a promising strategy for developing new targeted medicines for chemotherapy. However, the in vivo utility of such prodrugs is hindered by insufficient activation and the lack of convenient synthetic methods. We have developed an innovative strategy for synthesizing ketal glycoside prodrugs that are unique in being activated by a dual enzyme- and acid-triggered self-immolative mechanism. Amphiphilic glucosyl acetone-based ketal-linked etoposide glycoside prodrug isomers were synthesized and fabricated into excipient-free nanoparticles for effective cancer prodrug monotherapy. Hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkage or the ketal linkage triggered hydrolysis of the other linkage, which resulted in spontaneous self-immolative hydrolysis of the prodrugs. Nanoparticles of the prodrug isomer that was the most labile in a lysosome-mimicking environment displayed high intratumoral accumulation and strong antitumor activity in an A549 xenograft mouse model. Our strategy may be useful for the development of stimulus-responsive self-immolative prodrugs and their nanomedicines."
Simultaneous Sensing of Multiple Cancer Biomarkers by a Single DNA Nanoprobe in a Nanopore,"Both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) are key biomarkers in tumor angiogenesis. Determination of the overexpression of the two biomarkers would provide valuable information on the progression of tumor growth and metastasis, but their simultaneous quantification by a single probe is unprecedented. Here, we develop a triplex DNA-based nanoprobe for simultaneously quantifying VEGF and MMP-9 using an α-hemolysin nanopore. A DNA aptamer is used as the triplex molecular beacon (tMB) loop to bind VEGF, and a stem-forming oligonucleotide modified with a short peptide is used to recognize MMP-9. The sequential presence of VEGF and MMP-9 could also be identified by different patterns of current events. Besides, the characteristic current events generated by the DNA probe possess pH-dependent patterns that can be used to reflect the environmental pH. Success in the construction of such DNA nanoprobes will greatly facilitate the investigation of the mechanisms of different tumor angiogenesis processes and provide a useful approach for cancer diagnosis."
Sulfadiazine hosted in MIL-53(Al) as a biocide topical delivery system,"Sulfadiazine (SDZ), a bacteriostatic agent, was hosted in a metal-organic framework, specifically in MIL-53(Al) and modified-zinc MIL-53(Al,Zn). Materials were characterized structural, and texturally. Both hosts loaded sulfadiazine but they were differenced regarding the release of sulfadiazine. The presence of zinc plays a significant role to the modulation of sulfadiazine-MOF interactions. Release of sulfadiazine from sulfadiazine@MOFs was monitored in vitro and ex vivo conditions. A kinetic release model is proposed for in vitro sulfadiazine release. Remarkably, the materials did not show cytotoxicity against eukaryote cells."
Workshop Report: Governance of Emerging Nanotechnology Risks in the Semiconductor Industry,"Assessment of risk in the field of nanotechnology requires an integrated multidisciplinary approach due to the complex and cross-disciplinary framework for materials and activities at the nanoscale. The present paper summarizes the workshop “Governance of emerging nano-risk in the semiconductor industry” held on April 26, 2018 in Brussels, Belgium. The event targeted representatives of stakeholder communities involved in the risk assessment and governance of the engineered nanomaterials. Nanoelectronics was selected as an impactful use case for risk assessment approaches and comparison to bottom-up nanofabrication. The workshop outlined key data gaps impeding successful assessment of risks associated with nanoparticle use in the industry, using the semiconductor industry as an example. The workshop outlined mitigation strategies informing future regulatory decisions and identified some directions for future efforts."
Toxicity and mechanism of mesoporous silica nanoparticles in eyes,"The study on the safety of nanomaterials in eyes is still in its early stages. In this study, we put our focus on the effect of one important nanoparticle feature-large surface area-to assess eye safety. To this end, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSiNPs) were for the first time employed as a model to evaluate their toxicity in eyes. The porosity of the MSiNPs endows them with a large surface area and the ability to attach to surrounding chemical or biological molecules, further enhancing their surface reactivity and toxic effects. Therefore, to better mimic MSiNP exposure in real environments, we also introduced other hazardous substances such as silver ions (Ag+) to the system and then investigated their synergistic nanotoxicity. Our results showed that the exposure to MSiNPs-Ag+ and even Ag+ at a safe dose, resulted in more significant toxicity than the MSiNPs alone, as evidenced from cell viability, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and DNA damage experiments. RNA-Sequencing analysis revealed that the mRNA surveillance signalling pathway plays a unique role in regulating MSiNPs-Ag+-induced cytotoxicity. Besides this, severe corneal damage and dry eye were observed in rat models upon exposure to MSiNPs-Ag+ compared to MSiNPs. Most importantly, we also proposed a protein corona-based therapy to treat MSiNP-induced corneal disease, where the corneal damage could be rescued by fetal bovine serum (FBS) treatment."
Water-processable liquid metal nanoparticles by single-step polymer encapsulation,"Stabilizing metastable colloids such as gallium-based liquid metal nanoparticles (LM NPs) and using them in complex machining processes is a great challenge due to their simple and sensitive surface chemistry against ligand modification and solution processing. Water, a green solvent, is unfortunately not favored by LM NPs in the entire workflow from synthesis to functionalization and application. This dilemma is relieved herein by presenting a sonochemical polymer deposition technique that can produce a water-dispersible LM@polymer hybrid nanomaterial in one step. Water-soluble polymers such as poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) can be directly deposited onto eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) as a coating shell (up to 20 nm) and prevent their rapid and continuous oxidation in aqueous solutions. EGaIn@PVP NPs are stable after preservation for 30 days in water and 60 days in ethanol, and the polymer coating shows solvent-responsive swelling/shrinking behaviors. The LM@polymer NPs can be stably composited with other materials through complex processing and perform desired functions after composition. For demonstration, EGaIn@PVP NPs are employed as active electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries by compositing with water-soluble binders, and exhibit excellent cycling performances with no obvious decay (capacity retention >95%) in more than 700 cycles at 4 A g-1. This strategy enriches the toolbox for surface engineering of LMs especially under harsh conditions, which can benefit the applications of LM NPs in various scenarios."
Drug-internalized bacterial swimmers for magnetically manipulable tumor-targeted drug delivery,"Tumor-targeted drug carriers are becoming attractive for precise drug delivery in anti-tumor therapy. However, a lot of the reported drug delivery systems are complicatedly designed and their destiny in vivo is beyond our control, which limited their clinical applications. Hence, it is urgently needed to develop spatio-manipulable self-propelled nanosystems for drug delivery in a facile way. Here, we have successfully constructed drug-internalized bacterial swimmers, whose movement can be manually controlled by an external magnetic field (MF). We demonstrate that the swimmers maintain the mobility to align and swim along MF lines. Further studies reveal that the doxorubicin (DOX-) internalized bacterial swimmers are able to navigate toward tumor sites under the guidance of MF, rendering enhanced anti-tumor efficacy compared with that of dead ones and free DOX. Therefore, the MF-guided bacterial swimmers hold great promise for spatio-manipulable drug delivery in precision medicine."
Hydroxypropyl Guar/Cellulose Nanocrystal Film with Ionic Liquid and Anthocyanin for Real-Time and Visual Detection of NH<inf>3</inf>,"Simple, fast, and accurate detection of food freshness is of considerable significance to ensure food safety. The pH values of foods can be good indicators of their freshness, which can be used for real-time detection of food quality. Herein, we fabricated a pH-sensing film for flexible smart labels based on hydroxypropyl guar (HPG), cellulose nanocrystal (CNC), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BmimCl), a kind of ionic liquid (IL), and anthocyanin (Anth). We investigated the structure, optical properties, and mechanical strength of the composite films. These films can be used to detect ammonia (NH3) generated from seafood during storage by pH-sensing capability and monitor the real-time freshness of seafood. The HPG/CNC/IL/Anth film exhibited several advantages, such as wide color-change range, easy identification, high sensitivity, good reversibility, excellent stability, and low detection limit. The pH-sensing films can function as flexible smart labels for real-time, visual, and accurate detection of food freshness in cold chain logistics and other fields."
"Comparative study of nanoparticle uptake and impact in murine lung, liver and kidney tissue slices","To determine responses to nanoparticles in a more comprehensive way, current efforts in nanosafety aim at combining the analysis of multiple endpoints and comparing outcomes in different models. To this end, here we used tissue slices from mice as 3D ex vivo models and performed for the first time a comparative study of uptake and impact in liver, lung, and kidney slices exposed under the same conditions to silica, carboxylated and amino-modified polystyrene. In all organs, only exposure to amino-modified polystyrene induced toxicity, with stronger effects in kidneys and lungs. Uptake and distribution studies by confocal microscopy confirmed nanoparticle uptake in all slices, and, in line with what observed in vivo, preferential accumulation in the macrophages. However, uptake levels in kidneys were minimal, despite the strong impact observed when exposed to the amino-modified polystyrene. On the contrary, nanoparticle uptake and accumulation in macrophages were particularly evident in lung slices. Thus, tissue digestion was used to recover all cells from lung slices at different exposure times and to determine by flow cytometry detailed uptake kinetics in lung macrophages and all other cells, confirming higher uptake by the macrophages. Finally, the expression levels of a panel of targets involved in inflammation and macrophage polarization were measured to determine potential effects induced in lung and liver tissue. Overall, this comparative study allowed us to determine uptake and impact of nanoparticles in real tissue and identify important differences in outcomes in the organs in which nanoparticles distribute."
Metabolomics profiling to investigate nanomaterial toxicity in vitro and in vivo,"Nanomaterials (NMs) can be produced in plenty of variants posing several challenges for NM hazard and risk assessment. Metabolomic profiling of NM-treated cells and tissues allows for insights into underlying Mode-of-Action (MoA) and offers several advantages in this context. It supports the description of Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) and, therefore, tailored AOP-based hazard testing strategies. Moreover, it bears great potential for biomarker discovery supporting toxicity prediction. Here, we applied metabolomics profiling to cells treated with four well-selected SiO2 variants, differing in structure, size and surface charge. TiO2 NM-105 served as a benchmark. Responses were studied in vitro in rat lung epithelial cells (RLE-6TN) and alveolar macrophages (NR8383) and compared to in vivo responses in rat lung tissues obtained from in vivo instillation and short-term inhalation studies (STIS). Time- and concentration-dependent changes were observed in both in vitro models but with cell-type specific responses. Overall, the levels of lipids and biogenic amines (BAs) tended to increase in epithelial cells but decreased in macrophages. Many identified metabolites like Met-SO, hydroxy-Pro and spermidine were related to oxidative stress, indicating that oxidative stress contributes to the MoA for the selected NMs. Several biomarker candidates such as Asp, Asn, Ser, Pro, spermidine, putrescine and LysoPCaC16:1 were identified in vitro and verified in vivo. In this study, we successfully applied a metabolomics workflow for in vitro and in vivo samples, which proved to be well suited to identify potential biomarkers, to gain insights into NM structure–activity relationship and into the underlying MoA."
Silver nanoparticles compromise the development of mouse pubertal mammary glands through disrupting internal estrogen signaling,"Despite numerous studies on the environmental health and safety (EHS) of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), most studies looked into their gross toxicities with rather limited understanding on their labyrinthine implicit effects on the target sites, such as the endocrine system. Burgeoning evidence documents the disrupting effects of AgNPs on endocrine functions; however, little research has been invested to recognize the potential impacts on the mammary gland, a susceptible estrogen-responsive organ. Under this setting, we here aimed to scrutinize AgNP-induced effects on the development of pubertal mammary glands at various concentrations that bear significant EHS relevance. We unearthed that AgNPs could accumulate in mouse mammary glands and result in a decrease in the percentage of ducts and terminal ducts in the adult mice after chronic exposure. Strikingly, smaller sized AgNPs showed greater capability to alter the pubertal mammary development than larger sized particles. Intriguingly, mechanistic investigation revealed that the reduction of epithelial proliferation in response to AgNPs was ascribed to reduced ERα expression, which, at least partially, accounted for diseased epithelial morphology in mammary glands. Meanwhile, the decline in fibrous collagen deposition around the epithelium was found to contribute to the compromised development of mammary glands under the exposure of AgNPs. Moreover, as an extension of the mechanism, AgNPs diminished serum levels of estradiol in exposed animals. Together, these results uncovered a novel toxicity feature of AgNPs: compromised development of mouse pubertal mammary glands through the endocrine-disrupting actions. This study would open a new avenue to unveil the EHS impacts of AgNPs."
Dispersion of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes in Biocompatible Environments,"Abstract: The unique physical and chemical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), including SWCNTs (single-walled carbon nanotubes), allow their applications in many fields, including biomedicine. The optical properties of SWCNTs are attractive for application in the field of nanobiotechnology compared to MWCNTs (multi-walled carbon nanotubes). An important objective of SWCNT application for biomedical purposes is obtaining homogenous dispersions characterized by bioavailability and biocompatibility. The possibility of obtaining homogenous dispersions of different types of SWCNTs in biocompatible media for further use in different biomedical experiments and applications has been investigated. The sizes of SWCNT agglomerates in prepared dispersions were measured by the method of dynamic light scattering; bioavailability was studied by dark field microscopy in BEAS-2B bronchial epithelium cells. The dispersions were analyzed for the presence of bacterial contamination. Biocompatible and bioavailable dispersions have been obtained on the basis of cell culture media and 1% bovine serum albumin, which can be used in experiments on assessing the safety of SWCNTs at biological objects but have a number of limitations in the field of biomedicine. Dispergents based on lung surfactant components, which could be used in biomedical applications (DPPC and Survanta®), did not show efficency."
An artificial metalloenzyme for catalytic cancer-specific DNA cleavage and operando imaging,"Metalloenzymes are promising anticancer candidates to overcome chemoresistance by involving unique mechanisms. To date, it is still a great challenge to obtain synthetic metalloenzymes with persistent catalytic performance for cancer-specific DNA cleavage and operando imaging. Here, an artificial metalloenzyme, copper cluster firmly anchored in bovine serum albumin conjugated with tumor-targeting peptide, is exquisitely constructed. It is capable of persistently transforming hydrogen peroxide in tumor microenvironment to hydroxyl radical and oxygen in a catalytic manner. The stable catalysis recycling stems from the electron transfer between copper cluster and substrate with well-matched energy levels. Notably, their high biocompatibility, tumor-specific recognition, and persistent catalytic performance ensure the substantial anticancer efficacy by triggering DNA damage. Meanwhile, by coupling with enzyme-like reactions, the operando therapy effect is expediently traced by chemiluminescence signal with high sensitivity and sustainability. It provides new insights into synthesizing biocompatible metalloenzymes on demand to visually monitor and efficiently combat specific cancers."
The longer the worse: A combined proteomic and targeted study of the long-term: Versus short-term effects of silver nanoparticles on macrophages,"Despite considerable research effort devoted to the study of the effects of silver nanoparticles on mammalian cells in recent years, data on the potential long term effects of this nanomaterial remain scarce, and centered on epithelial cells. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of silver nanoparticles on macrophages. To this end, RAW 264.7 murine macrophages were exposed to either 1 μg ml-1 silver nanoparticles for 20 days, i.e. a chronic exposure scheme, or to 20 μg ml-1 silver nanoparticles for 24 hours, i.e. an acute exposure scheme. A proteomic study was then conducted to study and compare the cellular responses to both exposure schemes. They proved to be essentially different, and stronger for the chronic exposure scheme. Targeted validation studies showed effects of chronic exposure to silver nanoparticles on detoxifying enzymes such as flavin reductase, which was increased, and on central metabolism enzymes such as triose phosphate isomerase, the activity of which decreased under chronic exposure to silver nanoparticles. Chronic exposure to silver nanoparticles also induced a decrease of reduced glutathione content, a decreased phagocytic activity and reduced macrophage responses to lipopolysaccharide, as exemplified by nitric oxide and interleukin 6 production. Overall, chronic exposure to silver nanoparticles induced stronger effects than acute exposure on macrophages in the metabolic (glutathione level, mitochondrial potential) and functional (phagocytosis, cytokine production) parameters tested.

"Graphene, other carbon nanomaterials and the immune system: Toward nanoimmunity-by-design","Carbon-based materials (CBMs), such as graphene, nanodiamonds, carbon fibers, and carbon dots, have attracted a great deal scientific attention due to their potential as biomedical tools. Following exposure, particularly intravenous injection, these nanomaterials can be recognized by immune cells. Such interactions could be modulated by the different physicochemical properties of the materials (e.g. structure, size, and chemical functions), by either stimulating or suppressing the immune response. However, a harmonized cutting-edge approach for the classification of these materials based not only on their physicochemical parameters but also their immune properties has been missing. The European Commission-funded G-IMMUNOMICS and CARBO-IMmap projects aimed to fill this gap, developing a functional pipeline for the qualitative and quantitative immune characterization of graphene, graphene-related materials (GRMs), and other CBMs. The goal was to open breakthrough perspectives for the definition of the immune profiles of these materials. Here, we summarize our methodological approach, key results, and the necessary multidisciplinary expertise ranging across various fields, from material chemistry to engineering, immunology, toxicology, and systems biology. G-IMMUNOMICS, as a partnering project of the Graphene Flagship, the largest scientific research initiative on graphene worldwide, also complemented the studies performed in the Flagship on health and environmental impact of GRMs. Finally, we present the nanoimmunity-by-design concept, developed within the projects, which can be readily applied to other 2D materials. Overall, the G-IMMUNOMICS and CARBO-IMmap projects have provided new insights on the immune impact of GRMs and CBMs, thus laying the foundation for their safe use and future translation in medicine."
Noninvasive Monitoring of Choroid-Retina Autofluorescence and Intravitreal Nanoparticle Disposition in Royal College of Surgeon Rats of Different Ages and Retinal Thinning,"Purpose: To determine the baseline choroid-retina fluorescence signal in Royal College of Surgeon (RCS) rats of various ages with different degrees of retinal degeneration and assess the persistence of intravitreal nanoparticles. Methods: In RCS rats of age 6, 12, and 20 weeks and Sprague Dawley (SD) rats of age 6 and 20 weeks, baseline eye tissue fluorescence and retinal thickness were recorded noninvasively using fluorophotometry and optical coherence tomography (OCT), respectively. Further, 20-nm carboxylate-modified fluorescent particles were injected intravitreally in the above groups of rats, and the depth-wise fluorescence signal was monitored over 7 days using fluorophotometry and confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscopy (cSLO). Additionally, 200 nm particles of the same material were injected intravitreally into about 7-week-old RCS rats and the fluorescence signal was monitored up to 35 days using fluorophotometry. Results: Reduction in retinal thickness and an increase in choroid-retina and lens baseline fluorescence was observed with increasing age of RCS and SD rats. The 20 nm particles persisted in the vitreous of animals from all age groups for at least 7 days postadministration, irrespective of the differences in retinal thickness. cSLO confirmed nanoparticle persistence in the eye. The fluorescence signal from 200 nm particles persisted for 35 days in the vitreous humor. Conclusions: Choroid-retina and lens autofluorescence monitored using fluorophotometry increase with age. Intravitreally injected nanoparticles can be monitored noninvasively in rats using fluorophotometry and cSLO imaging. Both 20 and 200 nm particles persist in the back of the eye tissues, for several days following intravitreal injection."
Surface stabilization affects toxicity of silver nanoparticles in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are one of the most investigated metal-based nanomaterials. Their biocidal activity boosted their application in both diagnostic and therapeutic medical systems. It is therefore crucial to provide sound evidences for human-related safety of AgNPs. This study aimed to enhance scientific knowledge with regard to biomedical safety of AgNPs by investigating how their different surface properties affect human immune system. Methods: preparation, characterization and stability evaluation was performed for four differently coated AgNPs encompassing neutral, positive and negative agents used for their surface stabilization. Safety aspects were evaluated by testing interaction of AgNPs with fresh human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMC) by means of particle cellular uptake and their ability to trigger cell death, apoptosis and DNA damages through induction of oxidative stress and damages of mitochondrial membrane. Results: all tested AgNPs altered morphology of freshly isolated hPBMC inducing apoptosis and cell death in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Highest toxicity was observed for positively-charged and protein-coated AgNPs. Cellular uptake of AgNPs was also dose-dependently increased and highest for positively charged AgNPs. Intracellularly, AgNPs induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and damaged mitochondrial membrane. Depending on the dose, all AgNPs exhibited genotoxic potential. Conclusions: this study provides systematic and comprehensive data showing how differently functionalized AgNPs may affect the human immune system. Presented results are a valuable scientific contribution to safety assessment of nanosilver-based blood-contacting medical products."
Glucose-responsive cascaded nanocatalytic reactor with self-modulation of the tumor microenvironment for enhanced chemo-catalytic therapy,"Tumor microenvironment (TME)-mediated nanocatalytic therapy has been deemed as a promising strategy for improving the effectiveness of tumor therapy. Herein, we construct a glucose-responsive cascaded nanocatalytic reactor (MoS2@CGTC NCR) which co-loads glucose oxidase (GOx) and chemotherapeutic drug tirapazamine (TPZ) on the surface of the MoS2 nanozyme carrier for modulating the TME to achieve self-enhanced chemo-catalytic therapy. Based on the intratumoral ultrahigh glucose concentration, the MoS2@CGTC NCR can persistently regulate the TME through oxidizing glucose to produce gluconic acid and H2O2, while rapidly depleting oxygen to activate the chemotherapeutic. Subsequently, the self-supplied H+ and H2O2 can markedly boost the subordinate peroxidase-like catalytic efficacy of nano-sized MoS2, yielding abundant highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (OH) for nanocatalytic therapy. Meanwhile, MoS2 can also deplete glutathione (GSH) to reduce the consumption of OH. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that the MoS2@CGTC NCR performed well in suppressing tumor growth via self-enhancing chemo-catalytic therapy. This work highlights the use of self-assembled NCRs for enhanced tumor synergetic therapy via TME regulation. This journal is"
Gold/alpha-lactalbumin nanoprobes for the imaging and treatment of breast cancer,"Theranostic agents should ideally be renally cleared and biodegradable. Here, we report the synthesis, characterization and theranostic applications of fluorescent ultrasmall gold quantum clusters that are stabilized by the milk metalloprotein alpha-lactalbumin. We synthesized three types of these nanoprobes that together display fluorescence across the visible and near-infrared spectra when excited at a single wavelength through optical colour coding. In live tumour-bearing mice, the near-infrared nanoprobe generates contrast for fluorescence, X-ray computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and exhibits long circulation times, low accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system, sustained tumour retention, insignificant toxicity and renal clearance. An intravenously administrated near-infrared nanoprobe with a large Stokes shift facilitated the detection and image-guided resection of breast tumours in vivo using a smartphone with modified optics. Moreover, the partially unfolded structure of alpha-lactalbumin in the nanoprobe helps with the formation of an anti-cancer lipoprotein complex with oleic acid that triggers the inhibition of the MAPK and PI3K–AKT pathways, immunogenic cell death and the recruitment of infiltrating macrophages. The biodegradability and safety profile of the nanoprobes make them suitable for the systemic detection and localized treatment of cancer."
Effect‐based approach to assess nanostructured cellulose sponge removal efficacy of zinc ions from seawater to prevent ecological risks,"To encourage the applicability of nano‐adsorbent materials for heavy metal ion removal from seawater and limit any potential side effects for marine organisms, an ecotoxicological evaluation based on a biological effect‐based approach is presented. ZnCl2 (10 mg L−1) contaminated artificial seawater (ASW) was treated with newly developed eco‐friendly cellulose‐based nanosponges (CNS) (1.25 g L−1 for 2 h), and the cellular and tissue responses of marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis were measured before and after CNS treatment. A control group (ASW only) and a negative control group (CNS in ASW) were also tested. Methods: A significant recovery of Zn‐induced damages in circulating immune and gill cells and mantle edges was observed in mussels exposed after CNS treatment. Genetic and chromosomal damages reversed to control levels in mussels’ gill cells (DNA integrity level, nuclear abnormalities and apoptotic cells) and hemocytes (micronuclei), in which a recovery of lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) was also observed. Damage to syphons, loss of cilia by mantle edge epithelial cells and an increase in mucous cells in ZnCl2‐exposed mussels were absent in specimens after CNS treatment, in which the mantle histology resembled that of the controls. No effects were observed in mussels exposed to CNS alone. As further proof of CNS’ ability to remove Zn(II) from ASW, a significant reduction of >90% of Zn levels in ASW after CNS treatment was observed (from 6.006 to 0.510 mg L−1). Ecotoxicological evaluation confirmed the ability of CNS to remove Zn from ASW by showing a full recovery of Zn-induced toxicological responses to the levels of mussels exposed to ASW only (controls). An effect-based approach was thus proven to be useful in order to further support the environmentally safe (ecosafety) application of CNS for heavy metal removal from seawater."
Nanotoxicology and nanosafety: Safety-by-design and testing at a glance,"This review offers a systematic discussion about nanotoxicology and nanosafety associated with nanomaterials during manufacture and further biomedical applications. A detailed introduction on nanomaterials and their most frequently uses, followed by the critical risk aspects related to regulatory uses and commercialization, is provided. Moreover, the impact of nanotoxicology in research over the last decades is discussed, together with the currently available toxicological methods in cell cultures (in vitro) and in living organisms (in vivo). A special focus is given to inorganic nanoparticles such as titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). In vitro and in vivo case studies for the selected nanoparticles are discussed. The final part of this work describes the significance of nano-security for both risk assessment and environmental nanosafety. “Safety-by-Design” is defined as a starting point consisting on the implementation of the principles of drug discovery and development. The concept “Safety-by-Design” appears to be a way to “ensure safety”, but the superficiality and the lack of articulation with which it is treated still raises many doubts. Although the approach of “Safety-by-Design” to the principles of drug development has helped in the assessment of the toxicity of nanomaterials, a combination of scientific efforts is constantly urgent to ensure the consistency of methods and processes. This will ensure that the quality of nanomaterials is controlled and their safe development is promoted. Safety issues are considered strategies for discovering novel toxicological-related mechanisms still needed to be promoted."
Combination of tumour-infarction therapy and chemotherapy via the co-delivery of doxorubicin and thrombin encapsulated in tumour-targeted nanoparticles,"Drugs that induce thrombosis in the tumour vasculature have not resulted in long-term tumour eradication owing to tumour regrowth from tissue in the surviving rim of the tumour, where tumour cells can derive nutrients from adjacent non-tumoral blood vessels and tissues. Here, we report the performance of a combination of tumour-infarction therapy and chemotherapy, delivered via chitosan-based nanoparticles decorated with a tumour-homing peptide targeting fibrin–fibronectin complexes overexpressed on tumour-vessel walls and in tumour stroma, and encapsulating the coagulation-inducing protease thrombin and the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin. Systemic administration of the nanoparticles into mice and rabbits bearing subcutaneous or orthotopic tumours resulted in higher tumour growth suppression and decreased tumour recurrence than nanoparticles delivering only thrombin or doxorubicin, with histological and haematological analyses indicating an absence of detectable toxicity. The co-administration of a cytotoxic payload and a protease to elicit vascular infarction in tumours with biodegradable tumour-targeted nanoparticles represents a promising strategy for improving the therapeutic index of coagulation-based tumour therapy."
Human exposure to synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) is generally negligible as compared to natural compounds with higher or comparable endocrine activity: how to evaluate the risk of the S-EDCs?,"Theoretically, both synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) and natural (exogenous and endogenous) endocrine disrupting chemicals (N-EDCs) can interact with endocrine receptors and disturb hormonal balance. However, compared to endogenous hormones, S-EDCs are only weak partial agonists with receptor affinities several orders of magnitude lower. Thus, to elicit observable effects, S-EDCs require considerably higher concentrations to attain sufficient receptor occupancy or to displace natural hormones and other endogenous ligands. Significant exposures to exogenous N-EDCs may result from ingestion of foods such as soy-based diets, green tea and sweet mustard. While their potencies are lower as compared to natural endogenous hormones, they usually are considerably more potent than S-EDCs. Effects of exogenous N-EDCs on the endocrine system were observed at high dietary intakes. A causal relation between their mechanism of action and these effects is established and biologically plausible. In contrast, the assumption that the much lower human exposures to S-EDCs may induce observable endocrine effects is not plausible. Hence, it is not surprising that epidemiological studies searching for an association between S-EDC exposure and health effects have failed. Regarding testing for potential endocrine effects, a scientifically justified screen should use in vitro tests to compare potencies of S-EDCs with those of reference N-EDCs. When the potency of the S-EDC is similar or smaller than that of the N-EDC, further testing in laboratory animals and regulatory consequences are not warranted."
Is GSH Chelated Pt Molecule Inactive in Anti-Cancer Treatment? A Case Study of Pt<inf>6</inf>GS<inf>4</inf>,"Platinum (Pt) drugs are widely used in anti-cancer treatment although many reports advocated that tumor cells could inactivate Pt drugs via glutathione-Pt (GSH-Pt) adducts formation. To date, GSH chelated Pt molecules have not been assessed in cancer treatment because GSH-Pt adducts are not capable of killing cancer cells, which is widely accepted and well followed. In this report, endogenous biothiol is utilized to precisely synthesize a GSH chelated Pt molecule (Pt6GS4). This Pt6GS4 molecule can be well taken up by aggressive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Subsequently, its metabolites could enter nuclei to interact with DNA, finally the DNA-Pt complex triggers TNBC cell apoptosis via the p53 pathway. Impressively, high efficacy for anti-cancer treatment is achieved by Pt6GS4 both in vitro and in vivo when compared with traditional first-line carboplatin in the same dosage. Compared with carboplatin, Pt6GS4 keeps tumor bearing mice alive for a longer time and is non-toxic for the liver and kidneys. This work opens a route to explore polynuclear Pt compound with accurate architecture for enhancing therapeutic effects and reducing systemic toxicity."
Reversal of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by nanoparticle-based activation of immune-associated cells,"Immunotherapy that activates the host immune system to reverse immunosuppression has emerged as a new generation of cancer treatment in both preclinical studies and clinical trials. Although immunotherapy has shown significant achievements in the treatment of various cancers, it faces challenges that limit its further evolution such as poor permeation and modest responsiveness. The development of nanoparticle drug delivery system has provided an opportunity to overcome these drawbacks and to achieve optimized immunotherapy. Based on the research of our group, we here introduce the new strategies being employed using nanoscale intelligent drug delivery systems to enhance the effects of cancer immunotherapy. We also provide a perspective on the further possible application of nanoparticles in more effective antitumor immunotherapy."

Chemical nature and sources of fine particles in urban Beijing: Seasonality and formation mechanisms,"To mitigate air pollution in China, a legislative ‘Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan’ has been implemented by the Chinese government since 2013. There is, however, a lack of investigations for long-term trends in the composition, sources and evolution processes of PM1 (particulate matter with diameter less than 1 μm) after the implementation. To evaluate the effectiveness of these control measures, we present a year-long real-time measurement of the chemical composition of PM1 at an urban site in Beijing from November 2014 to November 2015, and the results are compared with previous studies from 2008 to 2013 to gain insights into the variations of the chemical composition and sources of PM1 in Beijing. Large seasonal differences were observed in the mass concentrations of PM1 species and general declining trend was observed in the last seven years. Specifically, the annual averages of mass concentrations in 2014–2015 decrease by 16–43% (PM1), 23–43% (organic aerosol, OA), 38–68% (sulfate), 26–51% (nitrate), 18–33% (ammonium) and 27–38% (chloride) compared to those from 2008 to 2013. During winter and summer, the seasonal mass concentrations of sulfate and nitrate show more significant declines especially in summer 2008 (79% and 81%) and summer 2011 (76% and 77%). The nitrate-to-sulfate ratio is higher in 2014–2015 (1.5 ± 0.6) than that in 2013 (1.0 ± 0.3), largely due to significant reduction in SO2 emissions, suggesting that nitrate is becoming more important than sulfate in particulate pollution in Beijing. OA is the dominant PM1 fraction (>45%) in all seasons and the mass concentrations/contributions of both primary and secondary OA show different seasonality. As for the more oxidized oxygenated OA (MO-OOA) and less oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA), the contributions of MO-OOA are much higher than those of LO-OOA (27–62% vs. 6–26%) in both high-pollution and low-pollution days. Aqueous-phase processes are found to facilitate the formation of MO-OOA while photochemical oxidation formation is a major contributor of LO-OOA in winter, and photochemical oxidation plays a major role in the formation of MO-OOA in summer and fall. The current study provides a comprehensive seasonal comparison of chemical composition and formation of PM1 in Beijing and a pacesetter in tackling PM pollution for other equally polluted megacities, after implementation of more stringent control measures after 2013."
In vitro cytotoxicity assessment of pristine and carboxyl-functionalized MWCNTs,"The wide use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in consumer products, i.e. composites, coatings, food packaging, etc, raise concerns about the adverse effects that CNTs can induce in humans and environment. Yet, there is no global consensus regarding risks that CNTs may pose, while controversial evidence exists also on the toxic effects associated with chemical surface modification, a prerequisite for their incorporation in different matrices. Moreover, there is limited information available about the underlying mechanisms, especially when cells’ interactions with the nanomaterial is assessed by imaging techniques. The present study aims at evaluating the in vitro cytotoxicity of pristine and oxygen functionalized multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) by assessing cell viability and apoptosis in combination with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations of stabilised cells. Direct observation of adenocarcinoma human epithelial cells (A549) was performed after incubation with 12.5, 50 and 100 μg/ml MWCNTs, for 0.5, 1 and 3 h, simulating a real exposure scenario during an accident, taking into account industrial safety issues during the production and use of the nanomaterial. Functionalized MWCNTs induced higher time- and dose-dependent toxic effects as compared to pristine. The SEM observations revealed the damaging effect on the cell membrane, offering insights about the toxic mechanism that takes place."
Transformable peptide nanoparticles inhibit the migration of N-cadherin overexpressed cancer cells,"About 90% cancer-related mortality results from the cancer metastasis, which generally undergoes after epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. N-Cadherin, overexpressed on cancer cell surface during EMT, can enhance the migration of cancer cells. Herein, we design and synthesize a transformable peptide BP-KLVFF-SWTLYTPSGQSK (BFS) that can block N-cadherin for inhibiting cancer migration and metastasis. The peptide BFS consists of three modules including (1) the hydrophobic bis-pyrene (BP) unit for forming and locating nanoparticles, (2) the KLVFF peptide sequence for forming and stabilizing fibrous structures and (3) the targeting peptide sequence SWTLYTPSGQSK that can specifically bind to N-cadherin. The peptide BFS can form nanoparticles in PBS, which can transform to nanofibers when targeting and binding to N-cadherin. The nanofibers inhibit the migration of N-cadherin overexpressed MDA-MB-436 cancer cells. The peptide BFS shows 83.6% inhibiting rate in cells wound healing assay. In addition, the inhibition rate is 67.9% when the BFS applied in transwell migration assay. These results indicate that the BFS has excellent ability to inhibit migration of cancer cells. This self-assembly strategy could be potentially utilized to regulate the key protein during EMT for inhibiting the tumor metastasis."
Ambient fine particulate matter exposure perturbed circadian rhythm and oscillations of lipid metabolism in adipose tissues,"Emerging evidence indicated that disruption of circadian rhythm (CR) induced metabolic disorders, including dysregulation of energy homeostasis and lipid dysfunction, which was associated with ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as well. However, the role and mechanism of CR in PM2.5-mediated metabolic disorder remain unknown. In the present study, we investigated circadian rhythmic characteristics and explored the effect of PM2.5 on oscillating clock of lipid function and metabolism in white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). C57BL/6 mice were exposed to PM2.5 in a whole-body inhalational exposure system. After 10 weeks, the expression of clock-related genes exhibits more robust CR in BAT than WAT, with the acrophase of PER2 in both types of adipose tissue being significantly decreased at ZT12 and Bmal1 increased at ZT0/24 in WAT in response to PM2.5 exposure. In addition, both CR pattern and expression levels of Sirt1 got significantly inhibited by PM2.5 exposure in WAT, accompanied with adipose dysfunction evidenced by inhibited pattern and expression levels of adipokines at the same ZT time points. Finally, a similar phase right shift from ZT4 to ZT12 in both Sirt3 and Ucp1 in BAT was induced by PM2.5 exposure. These findings indicate that disruption of the CR in adipose tissues could be an important way by which PM2.5 exposure induces metabolic disorder and provide potential targets for further investigation."
Ambient fine particulate matter disrupts hepatic circadian oscillation and lipid metabolism in a mouse model,"Emerging evidence has shown that exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with hepatic lipid accumulation. However, the underlying mechanism is not fully characterized yet. Autonomous circadian clock in the liver plays a fundamental role in maintaining lipid metabolism homeostasis. In this study, we evaluated the effects of ambient PM2.5 exposure on the expression of hepatic circadian clock genes and expression rhythm of genes associated with lipid metabolism in mice liver. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to ambient PM2.5 or filtered air for 10 weeks via a whole body exposure system. We found that the liver mass was reduced significantly at zeitgeber time (ZT) 8 in mice exposed to PM2.5 but not levels or circadian rhythm of hepatic triglycerides or free fatty acid (FFA). In addition, exposure to PM2.5 led to enhanced expression of bmal1 at ZT0/24, cry1 at ZT16 and rev-erbα at ZT4 and ZT8. Furthermore, the expression of pparα was enhanced in mice liver at ZT4 and ZT8 after PM2.5 exposure, with upregulation of pparα-mediated genes responsible for fatty acid transport and oxidation. Finally, the expression of rate-limiting enzymes for lipid synthesis was all significantly increased in the liver of PM2.5 exposed mice at ZT12. Therefore, the present study provides new perspectives for revealing the etiology of hepatic lipid metabolism abnormality from PM2.5-induced circadian rhythm disorder. Perturbing hepatic circadian oscillations and lipid metabolism with ambient fine particulate matter exposure."
An immunoassay based on lab-on-a-chip for simultaneous and sensitive detection of clenbuterol and ractopamine,"Both clenbuterol (CLB) and ractopamine (RAC) are β-adrenergic agonists. After long-term excessive intake, there will be adverse reactions such as headache, chest tightness, limb numbness, and serious life-threatening. Simultaneous detection of CLB and RAC in related samples is of great importance for human health. In this work, we outline a microfluidics-based indirect competitive immunoassay (MICI) system that can sensitively detect residual CLB and RAC in pork, swine blood and swine urine. The rapid detection of multiple samples can be achieved in one chip, which greatly improves the detection efficiency. This method has good stability and reproducibility and the microfluidic chips are easy to manufacture. The linear ranges for CLB and RAC detection by MICI are 0.1–2.5 ng/mL and 0.1–5 ng/mL, and the limits of detection (LODs) are 0.094 ng/mL and 0.091 ng/mL, respectively. This straightforward and portable immunoassay system provides a good platform for rapid detection of harmful substances in food samples."
Disturbed mitochondrial quality control involved in hepatocytotoxicity induced by silica nanoparticles,"The extensive application of silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) brings about inevitable occupational, environmental, and even iatrogenic exposure for human beings. The liver, which is rich in mitochondria, is one of the target organs of SiNPs, but the underlying mechanisms by which these nanoparticles (NPs) interact with liver mitochondria and affect their functions still remain unclear. In the present study, we examined silicon nanoparticle (SiNP)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, and further revealed its negative effects on mitochondrial quality control (MQC) in the human liver cell line L-02, including mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy and biogenesis. Consequently, SiNPs induced cellular injury, accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction, including mitochondrial reactive oxygen generation and mitochondrial membrane potential collapse. In line with the transmission electron microscopy (TEM)-observed abnormalities in the mitochondrial morphology and length distribution, a fission phenotype was manifested in the mitochondria of SiNP-exposed cells, and up-regulated DRP1 and FIS1, and down-regulated MFN1, were detected. Furthermore, the enhanced LC3II level, colocalization of the mitochondria and lysosomes, activated PINK1/Parkin signaling, and accumulated p62 in the SiNP-exposed cells suggested mitophagy disorder triggered by SiNPs. In addition, SiNPs inhibited mito-biogenesis, as evidenced by the reduced mitochondrial mass and mtDNA copy number, as well as the suppressed PGC1α-NRF1-TFAM signaling pathway. Overall, the study demonstrates that SiNPs trigger hepatocytotoxicity through interfering with the MQC process, bringing in excessive mitochondrial fission, mitophagy disorder and suppressed mito-biogenesis, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and ensuing cell damage, and ultimately contributing to the occurrence and development of liver diseases. Our research could provide important experimental evidence related to safety assessments of SiNPs, especially in the field of biomedical applications."
Ultrasound-Activated Cascade Effect for Synergistic Orthotopic Pancreatic Cancer Therapy,"In some malignant tumor, especially for pancreatic tumor, poor solid-tumor penetration of nanotherapeutics impedes their treatment efficacy. Herein, we develop a polymer-peptide conjugate with the deep tissue penetration ability, which undergoes a cascade process under ultrasound (US), including (1) the singlet oxygen 1O2 is generated by P18, (2) the thioketal bond is cleaved by the 1O2, (3) the departure of PEG chains leads to the in situ self-assembly, and (4) the resultant self-assembled PK nanoparticles show considerable cellular internalization. Owing to the synergistic effect of US on increasing the membrane permeability, the endocytosis and lysosome escape of PK nanoparticles are further enhanced effectively, resulting in the improved therapeutic efficacy. Thanks to the high tissue-penetrating depth and spatial precision of US, PTPK presents enhanced tumor inhibition in an orthotopic pancreatic tumor model. Therefore, the US-activated cascade effect offers a novel perspective for precision medicine and disease theranostics."
Risk Perceptions and Safety Cultures in the Handling of Nanomaterials in Academia and Industry,"Objectives: Work and research with nanomaterials (NMs) has primarily focused on innovation, toxicity, governance, safety management tools, and public perceptions. The aim of this study was to identify academia and industry occupational safety and health (OSH) managers' perceptions and handling of NMs, in relation to safety culture. Methods: Semistructured interviews were carried out with OSH managers at six academic institutions and six industrial companies. The interview statements were coded into five topics regarding NMs: risk comprehension, information gathering, actions, communication, and compliance. The statements were then coded according to a five-step safety culture maturity model reflecting increasing occupational safety maturity from passive, to reactive, active, proactive, and exemplary occupational safety. Results: The safety culture maturity of the academic institutions were primarily active and proactive, whereas the industry group were primarily active and reactive. None of the statements were rated as exemplary, with the majority reflecting an active safety culture. The topics varied from a passive approach of having no focus on NMs and regarding risks as a part of the job, to applying proactive measures in the design, production, application, and waste management phases. Communication and introduction to OSH issues regarding NMs as well as compliance provided challenges in both academia and industry, given the increasing cultural and linguistic diversity of students/staff and employees. Workplace leaders played a crucial role in establishing a legitimate approach to working safely with NMs, however, the currently available OSH information for NMs were described as insufficient, impractical, and inaccessible. There was an embedded problem in solely relying on safety data sheets, which were often not nanospecific, as this may have led to underprotection. Conclusions: There is a need for more structured, up-to-date, easily accessible, and user-friendly tools and information regarding toxicity and threshold limit values, relevant OSH promotion information, legislation, and other rules. The study underscores the need for politicians and engineers to collaborate with communication experts and both natural and social scientists in effectively framing information on NMs. Such a collaboration should allow for flexible deployment of multilevel and integrated safety culture initiatives to support sustainable nanotechnology and operational excellence."
Peptide-Based Nanoparticles Mimic Fibrillogenesis of Laminin in Tumor Vessels for Precise Embolization,"Cancer therapeutic strategies based on angiogenesis attract great attention from fundamental and clinical research. Blocking oxygen and nutrition supply to tumor cells could inhibit the growth of tumors based on occlusion of blood vessels in the tumor. Herein, we report a dual-responsive peptide-based nanoparticle, mimicking the laminin fibrillogenesis specifically and highly efficiently in tumor vessels, resulting in the blockage of tumor vessels and the growth inhibition of tumors. The laminin mimic peptide (LMMP) is designed with a fibrillation sequence, a pH-responsive sequence, and a targeting sequence. The LMMP in nanoformulations is delivered to blood vessels in the tumors, where the microenvironment (pH and microthrombus) enable LMMP to process laminin fibrillogenesis, constructing fibrous networks. The laminin-like fibrous networks capture red blood cells etc., forming occlusion specifically in the tumor blood vessels to inhibit the growth of the tumor."
Learning from the Machine: Uncovering Sustainable Nanoparticle Design Rules,"Machines consisting of bags of artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been constructed to connect nanoparticle features to the viability of a broad class of organisms upon exposure. The optimization of these machines is based on a relatively small data set. However, through consensus across a bag of ANNs, these machines predict at a level of confidence comparable to the experiment and perform better than chance. The mining of the machine across the feature space allows for the discovery of design rules for nanoparticles with increased viability. As such, we demonstrate the efficacy of inversion as an approach to learn from the machine in the context of designing sustainable nanoparticles. For example, we find that increased manganese content in lithium NiMnCo oxide nanoparticles is associated with greater viability, carbon dots reduce viability less than quantum dots, and gold nanoparticle coatings can significantly affect viability at high concentration."
Multifunctional DNA Polymer-Assisted Upconversion Therapeutic Nanoplatform for Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy,"Although considerable clinical attempts on various kinds of cancers have been made, photodynamic therapy (PDT) still suffers from attenuated therapeutic effects because of the developed resistance of cancer cells. As a novel antiapoptosis protein, survivin has been demonstrated to be selectively overexpressed in a great number of human malignancies and plays a significant part in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. Herein, we present an upconversion nanoplatform for enhanced PDT by DNAzyme-mediated gene silencing of survivin. In our system, a long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with a repetitive aptamer (AS1411) and survivin-targeted DNAzyme was fabricated by rolling circle amplification (RCA) and adsorbed on the upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) by electrostatic attraction. The multivalence of the ssDNA endows the upconversion nanoplatform with high recognition and loading capacity of photosensitizers and DNAzymes. When the nanoplatform is targeted internalized into cancer cells, PDT can be triggered by near-infrared (NIR) light to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for killing the cancer cells. Moreover, the encoded DNAzyme can efficiently inhibit the gene expression of survivin, providing the potential to enhance the efficiency of PDT. This study thus highlights the promise of an upconversion photodynamic nanoplatform for admirable combination therapy in cancer."

Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticle Cellular Uptake: Influence of Transient Bionano Interactions,"Ultrasmall nanoparticles are attracting an increasing interest for a variety of biomedical applications, from therapeutic targeting to imaging, in virtue of the peculiar behavior shown in vivo (i.e., efficient renal clearance, low liver accumulation, etc.). In evaluating their potential to overcome some of the challenges that larger particles have faced, it is important to understand their mechanisms of interaction with the cell membrane in relation to the biological environment and their tendency to transiently interact with biomolecules. In this work, the mechanism of cellular uptake across a range of serum concentrations is investigated using 2 nm gold nanoparticles with different surface chemistries as a model. The data suggest that despite their ultrasmall size, for these nanoparticles, internalization occurs via energy-dependent processes, and the surface chemistry could play a key role in determining the modality of the transient protein interaction, especially in conditions close to the in vivo scenario (large excess of the protein content). These aspects might be exploited to define novel targeting strategies."

Microporous Frameworks as Promising Platforms for Antibacterial Strategies Against Oral Diseases,"Nowadays, the heavy burden of oral diseases such as dental caries, periodontitis, endodontic infections, etc., and their consequences on the patients’ quality of life indicate a strong need for developing effective therapies. Bacterial infections played an important role in the field of oral diseases, in-depth insight of such oral diseases have given rise to the demand for antibacterial therapeutic strategies. Recently, microporous frameworks have attracted tremendous interest in antibacterial application due to their well-defined porous structures for drug delivery. In addition, intensive efforts have been made to enhance the antibacterial performance of microporous frameworks, such as ion doping, photosensitizer incorporation as building blocks, and surface modifications. This review article aims on the major recent developments of microporous frameworks for antibacterial applications against oral diseases. The first part of this paper puts concentration on the cutting-edge researches on the versatile antibacterial strategies of microporous materials via drug delivery, inherent activity, and structural modification. The second part discusses the antibacterial applications of microporous frameworks against oral diseases. The applications of microporous frameworks not only have promising therapeutic potential to inhibit bacterial plaque-initiated oral infectious diseases, but also have a wide applicability to other biomedical applications."
Factors Influencing the Interactions in Gelatin/Hydroxyapatite Hybrid Materials',"The most severe problem in bone regeneration is the defect in the interface. We prepared four types of implantation scaffolds of crosslinked gelatin (GE)/hydroxyapatite (HAp) to study the factors influencing interface interactions, they are film-crosslinked GE scaffold, gel-crosslinked GE scaffold, solid-crosslinked GE/HAp scaffold and gel-crosslinked GE/HAp scaffold. HAp could penetrate the entire GE matrix completely in four successive steps: physical preparation of a gel; chemical crosslinking; incubation in modified simulated body fluid (m-SBF) and freeze-drying. The penetrative nucleation and growth of HAp and the influencing factors in the GE matrix were investigated to ameliorate the interface interactions between organic and inorganic layers. During development of penetrative nucleation and growth, a tight connection was built between organic and inorganic layers, B-type carbonated HAp was formed after incubation with m-BSF, and the apatite content could be controlled. In summary, enhanced interface relies on not only the pre-seeded hydroxyapatite (HAp) as crystal nuclei but also the sufficient space for ions with high concentration to diffuse in."
Liquid metal exfoliation of two dimensional polydopamine nanosheets for templated assembly of noble metal nanoparticles,"We report the synthesis of freestanding quasi-2D polydopamine nanosheets through a liquid metal-assisted polymerization-exfoliation process. This material promises a functional platform for tailoring 2D composite materials, which is demonstrated by using it as both the reductant and the template for directing silver nanocubes into shaped metal-polymer frameworks."
An intelligent vancomycin release system for preventing surgical site infections of bone tissues,"Preventing surgical site infections (SSIs) of implants has drawn significant attention in both basic and clinical research. Implants with convenient preparation methods and intelligent drug release capabilities are highly needed to resist bacterial infection. Herein, we designed an intelligent drug-release system, which can be instantly incorporated with implants during the surgical process. The drug-release system involves β-glycerophosphate (β-GP) and chitosan (CS) as a thermosensitive hydrogel for instant construction onto implants and hyaluronic acid (HA) as a trigger to release vancomycin hydrochloride (VH) on demand. Tertiary calcium phosphate (TCP) scaffolds (implants) are vacuum-adsorbed in a solution of the intelligent vancomycin-release system (VH-HA-CS/β-GP), followed by heating for 40 min at 80 °C to form VH-HA-CS/β-GP@TCP. The drug-release hydrogel intelligently releases vancomycin depending on the concentration of hyaluronidase, which is secreted by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in infection sites. Furthermore, VH-HA-CS/β-GP@TCP showed effective antibacterial properties in vitro and in vivo. The VH-HA-CS/β-GP drug-release system can be conveniently prepared during surgery for intelligently preventing SSIs in bone tissue."
Controlling the morphology of metal-organic frameworks and porous carbon materials: Metal oxides as primary architecture-directing agents,"Owing to their large ratio of surface area to mass and volume, metal-organic frameworks and porous carbons have revolutionized many applications that rely on chemical and physical interactions at surfaces. However, a major challenge today is to shape these porous materials to translate their enhanced performance from the laboratory into macroscopic real-world applications. In this review, we give a comprehensive overview of how the precise morphology control of metal oxides can be transferred to metal-organic frameworks and porous carbon materials. As such, tailored material structures can be designed in 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D with considerable implications for applications such as in energy storage, catalysis and nanomedicine. Therefore, we predict that major research advances in morphology control of metal-organic frameworks and porous carbons will facilitate the use of these materials in addressing major needs of the society, especially the grand challenges of energy, health, and environment."
808 nm-activable core@multishell upconverting nanoparticles with enhanced stability for efficient photodynamic therapy,"Background: The unique upconversion properties of rare-earth-doped nanoparticles offers exciting opportunities for biomedical applications, in which near-IR remote activation of biological processes is desired, including in vivo bioimaging, optogenetics, and light-based therapies. Tuning of upconversion in purposely designed core-shell nanoparticles gives access to biological windows in biological tissue. In recent years there have been several reports on NIR-excitable upconverting nanoparticles capable of working in biological mixtures and cellular settings. Unfortunately, most of these nanosystems are based on ytterbium's upconversion at 980 nm, concurrent with water's absorption within the first biological window. Thus, methods to produce robust upconverting nanoplatforms that can be efficiently excited with other than 980 nm NIR sources, such as 808 nm and 1064 nm, are required for biomedical applications. Results: Herein, we report a synthetic method to produce aqueous stable upconverting nanoparticles that can be activated with 808 nm excitation sources, thus avoiding unwanted heating processes due to water absorbance at 980 nm. Importantly, these nanoparticles, once transferred to an aqueous environment using an amphiphilic polymer, remain colloidally stable for long periods of time in relevant biological media, while keeping their photoluminescence properties. The selected polymer was covalently modified by click chemistry with two FDA-approved photosensitizers (Rose Bengal and Chlorin e6), which can be efficiently and simultaneously excited by the light emission of our upconverting nanoparticles. Thus, our polymer-functionalization strategy allows producing an 808 nm-activable photodynamic nanoplatform. These upconverting nanocomposites are preferentially stored in acidic lysosomal compartments, which does not negatively affect their performance as photodynamic agents. Upon 808 nm excitation, the production of reactive oxidative species (ROS) and their effect in mitochondrial integrity were demonstrated. Conclusions: In summary, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using photosensitizer-polymer-modified upconverting nanoplatforms that can be activated by 808 nm light excitation sources for application in photodynamic therapy. Our nanoplatforms remain photoactive after internalization by living cells, allowing for 808 nm-activated ROS generation. The versatility of our polymer-stabilization strategy promises a straightforward access to other derivatizations (for instance, by integrating other photosensitizers or homing ligands), which could synergistically operate as multifunctional photodynamic platforms nanoreactors for in vivo applications."
Silica nanoparticles induce JNK-mediated inflammation and myocardial contractile dysfunction,"Increasing environmental exposure to silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) and limited cardiotoxicity studies posed a challenge for the safety evaluation and management of these materials. This study aimed to explore the adverse effects and underlying mechanisms of subacute exposure to SiNPs on cardiac function in rats. Results from echocardiographic, ultrastructural and histopathological analysis found that SiNPs induced cardiac contractile dysfunction, accompanied by incomplete myocardial structures, disordered sarcomere segments, interstitial edema and myocyte apoptosis in heart. Levels of myocardial enzymes and inflammatory factors were markedly increased in both serum and heart tissue, accompanied by elevated levels of oxidative damage occurred in the hearts of SiNPs-treated rats. SiNPs significantly upregulated the expressions of inflammation and contraction-related proteins, including JNK, p-JNK, c-Jun, TF and PAR1. Lentivirus transfection of JNK shRNA showed the low-expression of JNK-facilitated F-actin and inhibited TF in the SiNPs-treated cardiomyocytes. Moreover, SiNPs activated the mRNA and protein levels of JNK/TF/PAR1 pathway, and these effects were significantly dampened after JNK knock down. Our results demonstrate that SiNPs trigger myocardial contractile dysfunction via JNK/TF/PAR1 signaling pathway."
Probing Conformational Polymorphism of DNA Assemblies with Nanopores,"Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) can be designed to assemble into duplexes and other high-order structures through Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds. Incorporation of unnatural nucleobases or binding with small molecules can also introduce new interactions that give rise to novel DNA assemblies. However, the methods for determining the conformational properties of DNA assemblies are still very limited. Here we develop a new strategy for probing conformational polymorphism of different DNA assemblies. By installing poly(dC)30 tails to the ends of individual ssDNA that assemble into duplex, triplex, or other complex structures, we are able to observe different current blockade patterns corresponding to specific DNA nanostructures when the DNA assemblies are lodged inside α-hemolysin vestibule. We can also monitor the disassembly of the DNA nanostructures in solution. This method complements the existing traditional technologies such as circular dichroism spectroscopy, fluorescence labeling, and NMR spectroscopy, and shows distinct advantages of high accuracy and general applicability."
The recent progress in nanotoxicology and nanosafety from the point of view of both toxicology and ecotoxicology,This editorial aims to summarize the 14 scientific papers contributed to the Special Issue “Nanotoxicology and nanosafety 2.0 from the point of view of both toxicology and ecotoxicology”.
Titanium dioxide nanoparticles as oxidative stress inducers: A review on noxious corollary,"Unquestionably, the employment of nanotechnology in every enterprise depicts a future for sustainable development due to the cheap and clean availability of nanomaterials. Evidently, the researchers have largely centered on the blessings of nanomaterials in cosmetics and food industries failing to center the negative effects it could impose on human fitness and the environment. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is one such nanoparticle that despite its elite properties, is responsible for the generation of oxidative stress. This review compiles some significant research carried out for the assessment of accelerated oxidative stress markers and the presence of Titania traces in human samples and sea organisms; manifesting the way they are damaging the living mechanisms. The release of the nanoparticles into the environment somehow advances towards land and water contaminating the soil, rivers, and oceans and having a derogatory effect on the natural running phenomena of soil organisms, sea algae, and mussels. This review presents the latest findings and indicates making some strategies to reduce the use of nanomaterials to a significant but limited amount making sure that it is not responsible for any impairment to the humans and its surroundings."
Cellophane or Nanopaper: Which Is Better for the Substrates of Flexible Electronic Devices?,"Flexible electronic devices have gained broad applications in electrical sensors, photoelectrical displays, and energy storage devices, which result in a great demand for flexible and degradable substrates. The substrates require excellent thermal aging resistance to maintain the stability of flexible electronic devices in long-term use. Cellulose films, including cellophane, cellulose nanofibril (CNF) nanopaper, and cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) nanopaper, can be used as the substrates for flexible electronic devices. However, cellulose films prepared by different building blocks could affect thermal aging stability and the life of flexible electronic devices. In this work, the effects of thermal aging (105 °C for 5 days) on surface groups, crystalline structures, surface morphology, and mechanical, optical, and thermal properties of cellulose films were studied. Through sputtering and screen printing, conductive lines and circuits were prepared on cellulose films. The effects of thermal aging on electrical stabilities of conductive lines and circuits on cellulose films were investigated. Compared with the sizes of building blocks and crystalline structures of cellulose films, surface groups of building blocks were more responsible for thermal aging stability of cellulose films. As the substrate of flexible electronic devices, cellophane with hydroxyl groups exhibited better thermal aging stability (optical and thermal stabilities and stretchability) than nanopaper with carboxyl groups and sulfate ester groups."
Potentiation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon uptake in zebrafish embryos by nanoplastics,"The presence of microplastics in the environment and their potential effects on the health of organisms are a subject of great concern. However, with further weathering through UV radiation, mechanical force, and microbiological activity, most of these microplastics will degrade into nano-sized particles with exponentially higher specific surface areas compared to microplastics. Moreover, given that the hydrophobic surface of plastics adsorbs hydrophobic persistent organic pollutants (POPs), the possibility of nano-sized plastic particles potentiating POP sorption has been postulated. We developed a novel radiotracer-based method to investigate the sorption of a model POP, phenanthrene, onto the surface of two different-sized polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs). Using radiotracer analysis, we compared the transport and uptake of 14C-phenanthrene in zebrafish embryos with two different plastic particle sizes. We also evaluated whether nano-sized plastics altered the toxicity of phenanthrene and the acute sub-lethal responses to phenanthrene in zebrafish embryos. Our results demonstrate that 20 nm PS-NPs have higher sorption capacity for phenanthrene due to increased total surface area per gravimetric mass. Moreover, we demonstrate increased phenanthrene across the chorion and into zebrafish embryos with nano-sized plastics when compared to sub-micron sized plastics. Co-exposure to nano-sized plastics and phenanthrene delayed hatching and induced higher EROD activity in zebrafish embryos when compared to sub-micron sized plastics. The results of our study demonstrate that nano-sized plastics facilitate the transport and uptake of hydrophobic organic pollutants and increase both their bioavailability and potential toxicity to aquatic organisms.

Silica nanoparticles alleviate mercury toxicity: via immobilization and inactivation of Hg(ii) in soybean (Glycine max),"Mercury (Hg) pollution is a worldwide concern. Silica nanoparticles (nano-SiO2) can be released into ecosystems through natural and anthropogenic (engineered nano-SiO2) processes. Here, the influence of two sizes (30 nm and 50 nm) of artificial nano-SiO2 on Hg accumulation in soybean plants, the chemical form and distribution of Hg in plant tissues and the levels of chlorophyll and antioxidant enzymes in plants were investigated. The results showed that both sizes of nano-SiO2 amendments alleviated the growth inhibition induced by Hg and reduced the accumulation (62.2-83.6% in roots; 67.9-75.7% in stems; 45.0-70.7% in leaves lower with nano-SiO2 amendments vs. Hg-only exposure) and translocation (transport rates: 0.18-0.19 with nano-SiO2 amendments vs. 0.22-0.26 Hg-only exposure) of Hg in soybean seedlings. Compared with the Hg-only exposed groups, nano-SiO2 amendments significantly reduced the Hg concentrations in the epidermis and pericycle of the roots and stems, especially the pericycle measured by synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SRXRF). The application of nano-SiO2 also ameliorated the chlorophyll decrease (15.3-50.1% higher with nano-SiO2 amendments vs. Hg-only exposure) and antioxidant enzyme increase (20.7-33.2% lower with nano-SiO2 amendments vs. Hg-only exposure) induced by Hg stress. Additionally, the RS-Hg-SR bonding form in the roots of nano-SiO2 treated groups significantly decreased when compared with that of Hg-only exposed groups, and over 85% of the total Hg content was present in the form of R-Hg-Cl, which was largely consistent with the original Hg exposure species and indicated a low incorporation rate of Hg into plant tissues. This study explored the mechanism of nano-SiO2 against Hg toxicity in plants, and offered a new passivating agent option for Hg remediation. This journal is"
Quantitative structure–activity relationship models for predicting inflammatory potential of metal oxide nanoparticles,"BACKGROUND: Although substantial concerns about the inflammatory effects of engineered nanomaterial (ENM) have been raised, experimentally assessing toxicity of various ENMs is challenging and time-consuming. Alternatively, quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models have been employed to assess nanosafety. However, no previous attempt has been made to predict the inflammatory potential of ENMs.OBJECTIVES: By employing metal oxide nanoparticles (MeONPs) as a model ENM, we aimed to develop QSAR models for prediction of the inflammatory potential by their physicochemical properties.METHODS: We built a comprehensive data set of 30 MeONPs to screen a proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 beta (IL-1b) release in THP-1 cell line. The in vitro hazard ranking was validated in mouse lungs by oropharyngeal instillation of six randomly selected MeONPs. We established QSAR models for prediction of MeONP-induced inflammatory potential via machine learning. The models were further validated against seven new MeONPs. Density functional theory (DFT) computations were exploited to decipher the key mechanisms driving inflammatory responses of MeONPs.RESULTS: Seventeen out of 30 MeONPs induced excess IL-1b production in THP-1 cells. In vivo disease outcomes were highly relevant to the in vitro data. QSAR models were developed for inflammatory potential, with predictive accuracy (ACC) exceeding 90%. The models were further validated experimentally against seven independent MeONPs (ACC = 86%). DFT computations and experimental results further revealed the underlying mechanisms: MeONPs with metal electronegativity lower than 1.55 and positive f-potential were more likely to cause lysosomal damage and inflammation.CONCLUSIONS: IL-1b released in THP-1 cells can be an index to rank the inflammatory potential of MeONPs. QSAR models based on IL-1b were able to predict the inflammatory potential of MeONPs. Our approach overcame the challenge of time-and labor-consuming biological experiments and allowed for computational assessment of MeONP inflammatory potential by characterization of their physicochemical properties. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6508."
Translating scientific advances in the AOP framework to decision making for nanomaterials,"Much of the current innovation in advanced materials is occurring at the nanoscale, specifically in manufactured nanomaterials (MNs). MNs display unique attributes and behaviors, and may be biologically and physically unique, making them valuable across a wide range of applications. However, as the number, diversity and complexity of MNs coming to market continue to grow, assessing their health and environmental risks with traditional animal testing approaches is too time-and cost-intensive to be practical, and is undesirable for ethical reasons. New approaches are needed that meet current requirements for regulatory risk assessment while reducing reliance on animal testing and enabling safer-by-design product development strategies to be implemented. The adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework presents a sound model for the advancement of MN decision making. Yet, there are currently gaps in technical and policy aspects of AOPs that hinder the adoption and use for MN risk assessment and regulatory decision making. This review outlines the current status and next steps for the development and use of the AOP framework in decision making regarding the safety of MNs. Opportunities and challenges are identified concerning the advancement and adoption of AOPs as part of an integrated approach to testing and assessing (IATA) MNs, as are specific actions proposed to advance the development, use and acceptance of the AOP framework and associated testing strategies for MN risk assessment and decision making. The intention of this review is to reflect the views of a diversity of stakeholders including experts, researchers, policymakers, regulators, risk assessors and industry representatives on the current status, needs and requirements to facilitate the future use of AOPs in MN risk assessment. It incorporates the views and feedback of experts that participated in two workshops hosted as part of an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Working Party on Manufactured Nanomaterials (WPMN) project titled, “Advancing AOP Development for Nanomaterial Risk Assessment and Categorization”, as well as input from several EU-funded nanosafety research consortia."
Small molecule-decorated gold nanoparticles for preparing antibiofilm fabrics,"The increase in antibiotic resistance reported worldwide poses an immediate threat to human health and highlights the need to find novel approaches to inhibit bacterial growth. In this study, we present a series of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) capped by different N-heterocyclic molecules (N_Au NPs) which can serve as broad-spectrum antibacterial agents. Neither the Au NPs nor N-heterocyclic molecules were toxic to mammalian cells. These N_Au NPs can attach to the surface of bacteria and destroy the bacterial cell wall to induce cell death. Sonochemistry was used to coat Au NPs on the surface of fabrics, which showed superb antimicrobial activity against multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria as well as excellent efficacy in inhibiting bacterial biofilms produced by MDR bacteria. Our study provides a novel strategy for preventing the formation of MDR bacterial biofilms in a straightforward, low-cost, and efficient way, which holds promise for broad clinical applications."
An orthogonally regulatable DNA nanodevice for spatiotemporally controlled biorecognition and tumor treatment,"Despite the potential of nanodevices for intelligent drug delivery, it remains challenging to develop controllable therapeutic devices with high spatial-temporal selectivity. Here, we report a DNA nanodevice that can achieve tumor recognition and treatment with improved spatiotemporal precision under the regulation of orthogonal near-infrared (NIR) light. The nanodevice is built by combining an ultraviolet (UV) light-activatable aptamer module and a photosensitizer (PS) with up-conversion nanoparticle (UCNP) that enables the operation of the nanodevice with deep tissue-penetrable NIR light. The UCNPs can convert two distinct NIR excitations into orthogonal UV and green emissions for programmable photoactivation of the aptamer modules and PSs, respectively, allowing spatiotemporally controlled target recognition and photodynamic antitumor effect. Furthermore, when combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, the nanodevice results in regression of untreated distant tumors. This work provides a new approach for regulation of diagnostic and therapeutic activity at the right time and place."
Topical minoxidil-loaded nanotechnology strategies for alopecia,"Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a multifactorial and age-related condition characterized by substantial hair loss affecting both men and women. Conventional treatments include the use of topical minoxidil (MNX) formulations to stimulate hair growth and restore hair condition. However, those treatments are associated with limited performance and a lack of tolerability and compliance due to the emergence of adverse effects. Considering that the development of nanotechnology-based formulations as hair loss therapeutic strategies has been clearly growing, topical MNX delivery by means of these innovative formulations is known to enhance MNX skin permeation and depot formation into hair follicles, allowing for MNX-controlled release, increased MNX skin bioavailability and enhanced therapeutic ecacy with minimal adverse effects. This review highlights the potential of nanotechnology-based MNX delivery formulations for improved hair loss therapeutics, including a thorough assessment of their in vitro and in vivo performances, as well as regulatory and nanosafety considerations."

In vivo carcinogenicity study of silver nanoparticles in transgenic rasH2 mice by one single-dose intravenous administration,"Benefited from their broad-spectrum antimicrobial property, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been widely used in various daily life and medical products. Consequently, the bio-safety of AgNPs, especially long-term in vivo biological effects is of more and more importance. However, there are no correlated publications about AgNP carcinogenicity at present. Thus, in this study, we have investigated the potential carcinogenicity of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated AgNPs with an intermediate size (diameter ~ 42.5 nm). The C57-ras transgenic mouse model (CB6F1 Tg mice) harboring human c-Ha-ras gene was used to shorten the duration of in vivo experiments from 2 years to 22 weeks. CB6F1 Tg mice were intravenously injected by different single doses of AgNPs (0.4, 4, and 20 mg/kg body weight) during the 22-week carcinogenicity study. There were no obvious AgNP-related neoplastic lesions by microscope examination and no increase in the incidence of non-neoplastic lesions in the AgNP-treated mice in our study. Overall, these results indicate that AgNPs (≤ 20 mg/kg) do not cause carcinogenesis in CB6F1 Tg mice via a single-dose intravenous injection. This provides useful toxicological information and is of great importance to more applications of AgNPs in the future."
Size-Dependent Pulmonary Impact of Thin Graphene Oxide Sheets in Mice: Toward Safe-by-Design,"Safety assessment of graphene-based materials (GBMs) including graphene oxide (GO) is essential for their safe use across many sectors of society. In particular, the link between specific material properties and biological effects needs to be further elucidated. Here, the effects of lateral dimensions of GO sheets in acute and chronic pulmonary responses after single intranasal instillation in mice are compared. Micrometer-sized GO induces stronger pulmonary inflammation than nanometer-sized GO, despite reduced translocation to the lungs. Genome-wide RNA sequencing also reveals distinct size-dependent effects of GO, in agreement with the histopathological results. Although large GO, but not the smallest GO, triggers the formation of granulomas that persists for up to 90 days, no pulmonary fibrosis is observed. These latter results can be partly explained by Raman imaging, which evidences the progressive biotransformation of GO into less graphitic structures. The findings demonstrate that lateral dimensions play a fundamental role in the pulmonary response to GO, and suggest that airborne exposure to micrometer-sized GO should be avoided in the production plant or applications, where aerosolized dispersions are likely to occur. These results are important toward the implementation of a safer-by-design approach for GBM products and applications, for the benefit of workers and end-users."
D-penicillamine modified copper nanoparticles for fluorometric determination of histamine based on aggregation-induced emission,"A fluorometric method for the determination of histamine has been developed based on aggregation-induced emission (AIE) effect of D-penicillamine capped copper nanoparticles (DPA-CuNPs). The fluorescent DPA-CuNPs were synthesized by a one-pot method using D-penicillamine as both reducing agent and stabilizing ligand. The size, morphology and physical chemical properties of DPA-CuNPs were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fluorescence spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and absorption spectroscopy. The DPA-CuNPs exhibit AIE effect and show intense red fluorescence (650 nm). In the presence of histamine, DPA-CuNPs are dispersed into small homogeneous particles, causing fluorescence quenching. Based on this reaction, a histamine sensor is constructed. The fluorescence of the CuNPs solution has a good linear relationship with histamine concentration in the range 0.05 μM to 5 μM and the determination limit (3σ/slope) is 30 nM. The estimated method was successfully applied to the determination of histamine in fish, pork and red wine. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
Nanoliposome-encapsulated caged-GABA for modulating neural electrophysiological activity with simultaneous detection by microelectrode arrays,"Effective and precise neural modulation with real-time detection in the brain is of great importance and represents a significant challenge. Nanoliposome-encapsulated light-sensitive compounds have excellent characteristics such as high temporal and spatial resolution, delayed drug clearance, and restricted drug biodistribution for neural modulation. In this study, we developed a nanoliposome-based delivery system for ruthenium-based caged GABA compounds (Nanolipo-Ru) to modulate neural activity and allow for real-time monitoring using the microelectrode arrays (MEAs). The Nanolipo-Ru nanoparticles had an average size of 134.10 ± 4.30 nm and exhibited excellent stability for seven weeks. For the in vivo experiment in the rat, release of GABA by Nanolipo-Ru under blue light illumination resulted in an average firing rate reduction in interneurons and pyramidal neurons in the same brain region of 79.4% and 81.6%, respectively. Simultaneously, the average power of local field potentials in the 0–15 Hz range degraded from 4.34 to 0.85 mW. In addition, the Nanolipo-Ru nanoparticles have the potential to provide more flexible timing of modulation than unencapsulated RuBi-GABA in the experiments. These results indicated that Nanolipo-Ru could be an effective platform for regulating neuronal electrophysiology. Furthermore, nanoliposomes with appropriate modifications would render promising utilities for targeting of specific types of neurons in the future. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]"
Increasing complexity of nanocrystals,
Bioinspired One Cell Culture Isolates Highly Tumorigenic and Metastatic Cancer Stem Cells Capable of Multilineage Differentiation,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are rare cancer cells that are postulated to be responsible for cancer relapse and metastasis. However, CSCs are difficult to isolate and poorly understood. Here, a bioinspired approach for label-free isolation and culture of CSCs, by microencapsulating one cancer cell in the nanoliter-scale hydrogel core of each prehatching embryo-like core–shell microcapsule, is reported. Only a small percentage of the individually microencapsulated cancer cells can proliferate into a cell colony. Gene and protein expression analyses indicate high stemness of the cells in the colonies. Importantly, the colony cells are capable of cross-tissue multilineage (e.g., endothelial, cardiac, neural, and osteogenic) differentiation, which is not observed for “CSCs” isolated using other contemporary approaches. Further studies demonstrate the colony cells are highly tumorigenic, metastatic, and drug resistant. These data show the colony cells obtained with the bioinspired one-cell-culture approach are truly CSCs. Significantly, multiple pathways are identified to upregulate in the CSCs and enrichment of genes related to the pathways is correlated with significantly decreased survival of breast cancer patients. Collectively, this study may provide a valuable method for isolating and culturing CSCs, to facilitate the understanding of cancer biology and etiology and the development of effective CSC-targeted cancer therapies."
"Black Phosphorus Quantum Dots Cause Nephrotoxicity in Organoids, Mice, and Human Cells","Quantum dots (QDs) have numerous potential applications in lighting, engineering, and biomedicine. QDs are mainly excreted through the kidney due to their ultrasmall sizes; thus, the kidneys are target organs of QD toxicity. Here, an organoid screening platform is established and used to study the nephrotoxicity of QDs. Organoids are templated from monodisperse microfluidic Matrigel droplets and found to be homogeneous in both tissue structure and functional recapitulation within a population and suitable for the quantitative screening of toxic doses. Kidney organoids are proved displaying higher sensitivity than 2D-cultured cell lines. Similar to metal-containing QDs, black phosphorus (BP)-QDs are found to have moderate toxicity in the kidney organoids. The nephrotoxicity of BP-QDs are validated in both mice and human renal tubular epithelial cells. BP-QDs are also found to cause insulin insensitivity and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the kidney. Furthermore, ER stress-related IRE1α signaling is shown to mediate renal toxicity and insulin insensitivity caused by BP-QDs. In summary, this work demonstrates the use of constructed kidney organoids as 3D high-throughput screening tools to assess nanosafety and further illuminates the effects and molecular mechanisms of BP-QD nephrotoxicity. The findings will hopefully enable improvement of the safety of BP-QD applications."
Water treatment: functional nanomaterials and applications from adsorption to photodegradation,"Global efforts for engineering desired materials which are able to treat the water sources still are ongoing in the bench level methods. Considering adsorbent and photocatalytic materials as the main reliable candidates still are encountering with struggles because of many challenges that restrict their large-scale application. This review comprehensively considered the recent advanced materials water treatment methods which involve to magnetic, activated carbon, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene (G), graphene oxide (GO), (Graphene) quantum dots, carbon nanorods, carbon nano-onions, and reduced graphene oxide (RGO), zeolite, silica and clay-based nanomaterials. The adsorption and photocatalytic properties of these nanomaterials introduced them as highly potent option for heavy metal ions and organic dyes removal and photocatalytic degradation. High specific surface area in conjugation with presenting higher kinetics of adsorption and decomposition are the main characteristics of these materials which make them appropriate to treat wastewater even in ultralow concentration of the pollutants. Considering the mechanistic aspects of the adsorption and photocatalytic decomposition process, challenges and opportunities were other subjects that have been highlighted for the discussed nanomaterials. In term of the adsorption approaches, the mechanism of adsorptions and their influence on the maximum adsorption capacity were discussed and also for photocatalyst approach the radical active spices and their role in kinetic and efficiency of the organic pollutant decomposition were provided a deep discussion."
Transforming Scientists’ Understanding of Science–Society Relations. Stimulating Double-Loop Learning when Teaching RRI,"The problem of developing research and innovation in accordance with society’s general needs and values has received increasing attention in research policy. In the last 7 years, the concept of “Responsible Research and Innovation” (RRI) has gained prominence in this regard, along with the resulting question of how best to integrate awareness about science–society relations into daily practices in research and higher education. In this context, post-graduate training has been seen as a promising entrance point, but tool-kit approaches more frequently have been used. In this paper, we present and analyze an experiment—in the format of a Ph.D. course for early-career researchers—deploying an alternative approach. Drawing on Argyris and Schön’s (1974) framing of reflective practice, and their distinctions between espoused theories and theories-in-use, the analyzed course endeavored to stimulate double-loop learning. Focusing on dislocatory moments, this paper analyses how the course tried to teach participants to reflect upon their own practices, values, and ontologies, and whether this provided them with the resources necessary to reflect on their theories-in-use in their daily practices."
Designing Stimuli-Responsive Upconversion Nanoparticles that Exploit the Tumor Microenvironment,"Tailoring personalized cancer nanomedicines demands detailed understanding of the tumor microenvironment. In recent years, smart upconversion nanoparticles with the ability to exploit the unique characteristics of the tumor microenvironment for precise targeting have been designed. To activate upconversion nanoparticles, various bio-physicochemical characteristics of the tumor microenvironment, namely, acidic pH, redox reactants, and hypoxia, are exploited. Stimuli-responsive upconversion nanoparticles also utilize the excessive presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), riboflavin, and Zn2+ in tumors. An overview of the design of stimulus-responsive upconversion nanoparticles that precisely target and respond to tumors via targeting the tumor microenvironment and intracellular signals is provided. Detailed understanding of the tumor microenvironment and the personalized design of upconversion nanoparticles will result in more effective clinical translation."
Airborne environmental fine particles induce intense inflammatory response regardless of the absence of heavy metal elements,"Airborne environmental particles (EP) more commonly referred as particulate matter (PM) are an illustrative marker of air pollution that is associated with adverse effects on human health. Considering, PM is a complex mixture, not only in terms of its chemical composition, but also in the range of particle size, it is difficult to identify which attribute contributes more for the toxicity. Currently, there is no report about the immunotoxicological effects caused by PM with reduced content of heavy metals. This study intends to address this gap and provides a detailed characterization and immunotoxicity evaluation of PM collected in an urban area with heavy traffic congestion. Environmental particles were separated by different sizes though a sucrose gradient. This method allowed to achieve 4 sized fractions: EP f 15 % with a mean diameter of 284 nm ± 1.86 nm, EP f 25 % with a mean diameter of 461 nm ± 1.72 nm, EP f 35 % with a mean diameter of 1845 nm ± 251 nm and EP f 45 % with a mean diameter of 2204 nm ± 310 nm. Only the fractions with the smallest sizes (EP f 15 % and EP f 25 %) were subsequently studied. The chemical composition of both fractions was not substantially different, and the dominant elements were C, O, Ca and K. Only EP f 25 % showed to have a small amount of Fe. Therefore, the heavy metal elements were eliminated through centrifugation. Essentially, we found that the EP f 15 % was more cytotoxic in RAW 264.7 cells than EP f 25 %, which indicates the smaller size as the motive for the higher toxicity. In addition, both fractions of EP presented a good internalization in macrophages after 2 h exposure and induced the production of reactive oxygen species in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, EP f 15 % and EP f 25 % led to a strong secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) in the 3 concentrations tested. The inflammatory response observed was independent of the presence of heavy metals and endotoxins, since these last were suppressed by using polymyxin B sulfate. This report emphasizes the importance of an adequate physicochemical characterization and adequate controls in the experiments to achieve a right interpretation of the biological effects caused by PM."
Graphdiyne nanoradioprotector with efficient free radical scavenging ability for mitigating radiation-induced gastrointestinal tract damage,"X-ray irradiation-induced toxicity to gastrointestinal tract become a significant clinical problem when using radiotherapy for treating abdominal tumors neighbored to gastrointestinal tissue, which not only often prevents these tumors from receiving a definitive therapeutic dose but also causes a series of gastrointestinal diseases, such as anorexia, abdominal pain, diarrhea and hematochezia. And thus it seriously reduces the therapeutic outcome and life quality of patients. Therefore, the development of gastrointestinal radioprotectors is essential. However, the commercial gastrointestinal radioprotectors in clinical are still rare. In view of this, we prepared bovine serum albumin (BSA) modified graphdiyne (GDY) nanoparticles (GDY-BSA NPs) and for the first time studied its gastrointestinal radioprotection ability. The unique advantages of GDY nanomaterial, including high free radical scavenging ability, good chemical stability in gastric acid condition, relatively longer residence time in gastrointestinal tract and good biosafety under oral administration, provide the favorable prerequisites for it to be used as the gastrointestinal radioprotector. In vitro experimental results indicated that the GDY-BSA NPs powerfully reduced DNA damage and improved viability of the irradiated gastrointestinal cells. In vivo results showed that the GDY-BSA NPs significantly decrease radiation-induced diarrhea, weight loss, and gastrointestinal tissue pathological damage of mice. Furthermore, we also deeply studied the gastrointestinal radioprotective mechanism of GDY-BSA NPs, which indicated that the GDY-BSA NPs effectively inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced apoptosis signal pathway, and thus reduced gastrointestinal cell apoptosis. Our work for the first time employed BSA-GDY NPs to mitigating radiation-induced gastrointestinal tract damage, which not only promotes the exploration of new gastrointestinal tract radioprotectors, but also is the good guidance for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases by nano-drug."
Detection of enzyme-triggered peptide self-assembly via laser confocal Raman microscopy and circular dichroism spectroscopy in cellular environment,"Vibrational spectroscopy of peptides and peptide-based self-assembled macromolecules plays key role in early stage detection of cancerous and viral diseases. We provide here a rapid and accurate trace detection system for enzyme-triggered peptide self-assembly by taking a snapshot of peptide nanostructures to identify specific domains based on amino acid vibrational bands. The enzyme-triggered peptides present in both aqueous solution and human umbilical vein endothelial cells along with controlled cell lines were excited by a laser line of 543 nm, and intensities of Raman bands were recorded from 500 to 1,800 cm−1. The spectra consisted of several well-resolved peaks located at 655, 1,081, and 1670 cm−1 for peptide and at 834, 851, 896, and 915 cm−1 for enzyme, indicating vibrational bands of their functional groups. Raman signatures at 768, 1,144, 1,297, 1,305, and 1,571 cm−1 appeared in case of self-assembled peptides at new positions, indicating the presence of highly stable secondary structure of beta sheets. We studied here the 0.78 μg/ml limit of detection of peptide self-assembly with this technique in aqueous solution. These self-assembled nanomachines in cellular environment can be used to monitor and regulate the cellular processes for the diagnosis of biological diseases incorporated with our label-free laser confocal Raman microscopy methodology."
Microwave absorption properties of microporous CoNi@(NiO-CoO) nanoparticles through dealloying,"CoNi alloy is an important absorber and it can combine characteristics of transition metals Co and Ni with various advantages of strong magnetic loss, low cost and easy morphology control. The microporous CoNi@(CoO-NiO) nanoparticles (NPs) of about 45 nm are obtained by using hydrogen plasma metal reaction (HPMR) and dealloying methods. The Al element in Al9Co2, Al70Co15Ni15 and Al14Co3Ni3 phases can be dealloyed by NaOH at 323 K. The CoNi surface would oxidize to CoO and NiO, leading to the core@shell structure. The CoNi@(CoO-NiO)-paraffin wax composite displays high microwave absorption performance with minimum reflection loss (RL) of −38.1 dB at matching thickness of 5.0 mm. The effective absorption bandwidth (RL < −10 dB, at thickness of 2.0 mm) is 5.9 GHz. The RL values below −10 dB cover frequencies of 4.6–18.0 GHz with thickness ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 mm. The effective permittivity modification for a mixture of air and microporous CoNi host, and the large interfacial polarization relaxation of the CoNi@(CoO-NiO) structure contribute much to the enhanced microwave absorption performances."
Rapamycin-Loaded mPEG-PLGA Nanoparticles Ameliorate Hepatic Steatosis and Liver Injury in Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive lipid accumulation and liver injury, and is the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. There is an urgent need to develop novel pathophysiology-oriented therapy in human. Rapamycin (RAPA) has been recognized as a promising drug for alleviating hepatic steatosis on NAFLD, but the poorly water-soluble properties and side effects of RAPA limit their clinical use. In this study, we aimed to investigate the in vitro and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of biodegradable mPEG-PLGA polymers loaded with RAPA (NP-RAPA) on NAFLD. NP-RAPA were prepared by a green process using an emulsion/solvent evaporation method, the therapeutic efficacy on NAFLD were investigated on HepG2 cells incubated with oleic acid (OA) and in the livers of mice with NAFLD induced by high-fat diet (HFD). Compared with free RAPA, NP-RAPA significantly reduced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells, and obviously ameliorated hepatic steatosis and liver injury in mice though enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of RAPA through reducing SREBP-1c-dependent de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and promoting PPARα-mediated fatty acid oxidation. This study suggests that mPEG-PLGA can be used as the potential therapeutic strategy and novel drug delivery for improving the efficacy of rapamycin for treatment of NAFLD."
A photo-triggerable aptamer nanoswitch for spatiotemporal controllable siRNA delivery,"A photo-triggerable aptamer nanoswitch was proposed for spatiotemporal regulation of siRNA delivery. Recognition between AS1411 and nucleolin was effectively blocked by a photo-labile complementary oligonucleotide, which could be reactivated with photo-irradiation, resulting in efficient tumor-targeted siRNA internalization and gene silencing in vitro and in vivo."
Nanotoxicology data for in silico tools: a literature review,"The exercise of non-testing approaches in nanoparticles (NPs) hazard assessment is necessary for the risk assessment, considering cost and time efficiency, to identify, assess, and classify potential risks. One strategy for investigating the toxicological properties of a variety of NPs is by means of computational tools that decode how nano-specific features relate to toxicity and enable its prediction. This literature review records systematically the data used in published studies that predict nano (eco)-toxicological endpoints using machine learning models. Instead of seeking mechanistic interpretations this review maps the pathways followed, involving biological features in relation to NPs exposure, their physico-chemical characteristics and the most commonly predicted outcomes. The results, derived from published research of the last decade, are summarized visually, providing prior-based data mining paradigms to be readily used by the nanotoxicology community in computational studies."
A Heterojunction Structured WO<inf>2.9</inf>-WSe<inf>2</inf>Nanoradiosensitizer Increases Local Tumor Ablation and Checkpoint Blockade Immunotherapy upon Low Radiation Dose,"Radiotherapy (RT) in practical use often suffers from off-target side effects and ineffectiveness against hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME) as well as remote metastases. With regard to these problems, herein, we provide semiconductor heterojunction structured WO2.9-WSe2-PEG nanoparticles to realize a synergistic RT/photothermal therapy (PTT)/checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (CBT) for enhanced antitumor and antimetastatic effect. Based on the heterojunction structured nanoparticle with high Z element, the nanosystem could realize non-oxygen-dependent reactive oxygen species generation by catalyzing highly expressed H2O2 in TME upon X-ray irradiation, which could further induce immunogenic cell death. Meanwhile, this nanosystem could also induce hyperthermia upon near-infrared irradiation to enhance RT outcome. With the addition of anti-PD-L1 antibody-based CBT, our results give potent evidence that local RT/PTT upon mild temperature and low radiation dose could efficiently ablate local tumors and inhibit tumor metastasis as well as prevent tumor rechallenge. Our study provides not only one kind of radiosensitizer based on semiconductor nanoparticles but also a versatile nanoplatform for simultaneous triple-combined therapy (RT/PTT/CBT) for treating both local and metastasis tumors."
Immunological Responses Induced by Blood Protein Coronas on Two-Dimensional MoS<inf>2</inf>Nanosheets,"Two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets (NSs) have a large surface area, high surface free energy, and ultrathin structure, which enable them to more easily penetrate biological membranes and promote adsorption of drugs and proteins. NSs are capable of adsorbing a large amount of blood proteins to form NSs-protein corona complexes; however, their inflammatory effects are still unknown. Therefore, we investigated the pro-inflammatory effect of 2D model nanosheet structures, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), and the MoS2 NSs-protein complexes with four abundant proteins in human blood, i.e., human serum albumin (HSA), transferrin (Tf), fibrinogen (Fg), and immunoglobulin G (IgG). The interactions between the NSs and the proteins were analyzed by quantifying protein adsorption, determining binding affinity, and correlating structural changes in the protein corona with the uptake of NSs by macrophages and the subsequent inflammatory response. Although all of the NSs-protein complexes induced inflammation, IgG-coated and Fg-coated NSs triggered much stronger inflammatory effects by producing and releasing more cytokines. Among the four proteins, IgG possessed the highest proportion of β-sheets and led to fewer secondary structure changes on the MoS2 nanosheets. This can facilitate uptake and produce a stronger pro-inflammatory response in macrophages due to the recognition of an NSs-IgG complex by Fc gamma receptors and the subsequent activation of the NF-κB pathways. Our results demonstrate that the blood protein components contribute to the inflammatory effects of nanosheets and provide important insights for the nanosafety evaluation and the rational design of nanomedicines in the future."
Adverse outcome pathways as a tool for the design of testing strategies to support the safety assessment of emerging advanced materials at the nanoscale,"Toxicity testing and regulation of advanced materials at the nanoscale, i.e. nanosafety, is challenged by the growing number of nanomaterials and their property variants requiring assessment for potential human health impacts. The existing animal-reliant toxicity testing tools are onerous in terms of time and resources and are less and less in line with the international effort to reduce animal experiments. Thus, there is a need for faster, cheaper, sensitive and effective animal alternatives that are supported by mechanistic evidence. More importantly, there is an urgency for developing alternative testing strategies that help justify the strategic prioritization of testing or targeting the most apparent adverse outcomes, selection of specific endpoints and assays and identifying nanomaterials of high concern. The Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework is a systematic process that uses the available mechanistic information concerning a toxicological response and describes causal or mechanistic linkages between a molecular initiating event, a series of intermediate key events and the adverse outcome. The AOP framework provides pragmatic insights to promote the development of alternative testing strategies. This review will detail a brief overview of the AOP framework and its application to nanotoxicology, tools for developing AOPs and the role of toxicogenomics, and summarize various AOPs of relevance to inhalation toxicity of nanomaterials that are currently under various stages of development. The review also presents a network of AOPs derived from connecting all AOPs, which shows that several adverse outcomes induced by nanomaterials originate from a molecular initiating event that describes the interaction of nanomaterials with lung cells and involve similar intermediate key events. Finally, using the example of an established AOP for lung fibrosis, the review will discuss various in vitro tests available for assessing lung fibrosis and how the information can be used to support a tiered testing strategy for lung fibrosis. The AOPs and AOP network enable deeper understanding of mechanisms involved in inhalation toxicity of nanomaterials and provide a strategy for the development of alternative test methods for hazard and risk assessment of nanomaterials."
Recent Advances in Nanomaterials with Inherent Optical and Magnetic Properties for Bioimaging and Imaging-Guided Nucleic Acid Therapy,"Nucleic acid therapy is and will continue to be of great interest in cancer treatment. The development of nanocarriers with high nucleic acid loading capacity, low toxicity, and specific targeting, with excellent pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles, will enable us to realize safe and effective nucleic acid therapy. Tremendous efforts have been directed toward the production of optimized theranostic nanocarriers that can simultaneously provide treatment and real-time monitoring to aid researchers and physicians in making adaptation strategies during early drug development and patient's treatment, respectively. In this review, several nanomaterials with inherent optical and magnetic properties, developed for bioimaging and imaging-guided nucleic acid therapies, are introduced and discussed. In each subsection, the unique characteristics of the corresponding theranostic nanomaterials are reviewed and discussed with examples. Finally, we present the remaining challenges that must be addressed and provide our opinions on the future of nanomaterial medicines for bioimaging and imaging-guided nucleic acid therapy."
Metal-Based Nanocatalyst for Combined Cancer Therapeutics,"As a classical nanocatalyst-based therapeutic modality, chemodynamic therapy (CDT) has received more and more attention. To improve the therapeutic efficacy of CDT, various metal-based nanocatalysts have been designed and constructed to catalyze the Fenton or Fenton-like reaction in the past few years. However, the therapeutic efficacy of certain CDT is still restricted by the tumor microenvironment, such as limited concentration of intracellular H2O2, inappropriate pH condition, as well as overexpressed glutathione (GSH). Therefore, many other therapeutic modalities, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), starvation therapy, chemotherapy, and gas therapy, have been utilized to combine with CDT for increasing the tumor treatment performance. In this review, we summarized the development of combinatory therapeutic modalities based on CDT in recent years."
Detection of Circulating Tumor Cells by Fluorescence Microspheres-Mediated Amplification,"Here we describe a fluorescent microspheres-based separation and analysis that enables the isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from whole blood of patients with metastatic cancer and the identification of isolated CTCs in situ without immunostaining. This approach uses antibody-functionalized fluorescent polystyrene (PS) microspheres that can selectively bind to CTCs. The binding of CTCs and fluorescent PS microspheres leads to the formation of complexes of CTCs and fluorescent PS microspheres, thereby the CTCs are size-amplified and labeled simultaneously. A pyramidal microcavity array (PMCA) is fabricated using microfabrication technology to create a precise microfilter structure with a high aspect ratio. The PMCA filter device can effectively isolate microspheres-labeled CTCs, while allow hematologic cells to deform and pass through. Using this approach, CTCs are isolated and identified in 15 of 18 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. This approach will open new possibilities for CTCs isolation and identification and can serve a versatile platform to facilitate CTCs analysis in diverse biomedical applications."
Advanced in vitro testing strategies and models of the intestine for nanosafety research,"There is growing concern about the potential adverse effects of oral exposure to engineered nanomaterials (ENM). Recent years have witnessed major developments in and advancement of intestinal in vitro models for nanosafety evaluation. The present paper reviews the key factors that should be considered for inclusion in nonanimal alternative testing approaches to reliably reflect the in vivo dynamics of the physicochemical properties of ENM as well the intestinal physiology and morphology. Currently available models range from simple cell line-based monocultures to advanced 3D systems and organoids. In addition, in vitro approaches exist to replicate the mucous barrier, digestive processes, luminal flow, peristalsis, and interactions of ENM with the intestinal microbiota. However, while the inclusion of a multitude of individual factors/components of particle (pre)treatment, exposure approach, and cell model approximates in vivo-like conditions, such increasing complexity inevitably affects the system's robustness and reproducibility. The selection of the individual modules to build the in vitro testing strategy should be driven and justified by the specific purpose of the study and, not least, the intended or actual application of the investigated ENM. Studies that address health hazards of ingested ENM likely require different approaches than research efforts to unravel the fundamental interactions or toxicity mechanisms of ENM in the intestine. Advanced reliable and robust in vitro models of the intestine, especially when combined in an integrated testing approach, offer great potential to further improve the field of nanosafety research."
Safety assessment of nanomaterials for antimicrobial applications,"The interplay between nanotechnology and pathogens offers a new quest to fight against human infections. Inspiring from their unique thermal, magnetic, optical, or redox potentials, numerous nanomaterials have been employed for bacterial theranostics. The past decade has seen dramatic progress in the development of various nanoantimicrobials, which demands more focus on their safety assessment. The present review critically discusses the toxicity of nanoantimicrobials and the role of key features, including composition, size, surface charge, loading capability, hydrophobicity/philicity, precise release, and functionalization, that can contribute to modulating the effects on microbes. Moreover, how differences in microbe's structure, biofilm formation, persistence cells, and intracellular pathogens bestow resistance or sensitivity toward nanoantimicrobials is broadly investigated. In extension, the most important types of nanoantimicrobial with clinical prospective and their safety assessment are summarized, and finally, based on available evidence, an insight of the principles in designing safer nanoantimicrobials for overcoming pathogens and future challenges in the field is provided."
Nanomaterials and innate immunity: A perspective of the current status in nanosafety,"Human exposure to engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) is inevitable due to the plethora of applications for which they are being manufactured and integrated within. ENMs demonstrate plentiful advantages in terms of industrial approaches as well as from a consumer perspective. However, despite such positives, doubts remain over the human health implications of ENM exposure. In light of the increased research focus upon the potential effects of ENM exposure to human health in recent decades, questions still remain regarding the safety of these highly advanced, precision-tuned physical entities. The risk of short-term, high-dose exposure to humans is considered relatively low, although this has formed the direction of the hazard-assessment community since the turn of the 21st century. However, the possibility of humans being exposed repeatedly over a long period of time to a low-dose of ENMs of varying physicochemical characteristics is of significant concern, and thus, industry, government, academic, and consumer agencies are only now beginning to consider this. Notably, when considering the human health implications of such low-dose, long-term, repeated exposure scenarios, the impact of ENMs upon the human immune system is of primary importance. However, there remains a real need to understand the impact of ENMs upon the human immune system, especially the innate immune system, at all stages of life, given exposure to nanosized particles begins before birth, that is, of the fetus. Therefore, the purpose of this perspective is to summarize what is currently known regarding ENM exposure of different components of the innate immune system and identify knowledge gaps that should be addressed if we are to fully deduce the impact of ENM exposure on innate immune function."
Tissue specific fate of nanomaterials by advanced analytical imaging techniques - a review,"A variety of imaging and analytical methods have been developed to study nanoparticles in cells. Each has its benefits, limitations, and varying degrees of expense and difficulties in implementation. High-resolution analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) has the unique ability to image local cellular environments adjacent to a nanoparticle at near atomic resolution and apply analytical tools to these environments such as energy dispersive spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. These tools can be used to analyze particle location, translocation and potential reformation, ion dispersion, and in vivo synthesis of second-generation nanoparticles. Such analyses can provide in depth understanding of tissue-particle interactions and effects that are caused by the environmental ""invader"" nanoparticles. Analytical imaging can also distinguish phases that form due to the transformation of ""invader"" nanoparticles in contrast to those that are triggered by a response mechanism, including the commonly observed iron biomineralization in the form of ferritin nanoparticles. The analyses can distinguish ion species, crystal phases, and valence of parent nanoparticles and reformed or in vivo synthesized phases throughout the tissue. This article will briefly review the plethora of methods that have been developed over the last 20 years with an emphasis on the state-of-the-art techniques used to image and analyze nanoparticles in cells and highlight the sample preparation necessary for biological thin section observation in a HRSTEM. Specific applications that provide visual and chemical mapping of the local cellular environments surrounding parent nanoparticles and second-generation phases are demonstrated, which will help to identify novel nanoparticle-produced adverse effects and their associated mechanisms."
Interactions of tio<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles with ingredients from modern lifestyle products and their effects on human skin cells,"The number of consumer products containing nanoparticles (NPs) experienced a rapid increase during the past decades. However, most studies of nanosafety have been conducted using only pure NPs produced in the laboratory, while the interactions with other ingredients in consumer products have rarely been considered so far. In the present study, we investigated such interactions - with a special focus on modern lifestyle products (MLPs) used by adolescents. An extensive survey was undertaken at different high schools all over Austria to identify MLPs that either contain NPs or that could come easily in contact with NPs from other consumer products (such as TiO2 from sunscreens). Based on the results from a survey among secondary schools students, we focused on ingredients from Henna tattoos (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphtoquinone, HNQ, and p-phenylenediamine, PPD), fragrances (butylphenyl methylpropional, known as Lilial), cosmetics and skin-care products (four different parabens). As a cellular model, we decided to use neonatal normal human dermal fibroblasts (nNHDF), since skin contact is the main route of exposure for these compounds. TiO2 NPs interacted with these compounds as evidenced by alterations in their hydrodynamic diameter observed by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Combinations of TiO2 NPs with the different MLP components did not show altered cytotoxicity profiles compared to MLP components without TiO2 NPs. Nevertheless, altered cellular glutathione contents were detected after incubation of the cells with Lilial. This effect was independent of the presence of TiO2 NPs. Testing mixtures of NPs with other compounds from consumer products is an important approach to achieve a more reliable safety assessment."

Continuous-Flow Synthesis of ZIF-8 Biocomposites with Tunable Particle Size,"Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) biocomposites show the capacity to protect and deliver biotherapeutics. To date, the progress in this research area is based on laboratory batch methods. Now, the first continuous flow synthetic method is presented for the encapsulation of a model protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA) and a clinical therapeutic (α1-antitrypsin, AAT) in ZIF-8. The in situ kinetics of nucleation, growth, and crystallization of BSA@ZIF-8 were studied by small-angle X-ray scattering. By controlling the injection time of ethanol, the particle growth could be quenched by ethanol-induced crystallization from amorphous particles to ZIF-8 crystals. The particle size of the biocomposite was tuned in the 40–100 nm range by varying residence time prior to introduction of ethanol. As a proof-of-concept, this procedure was used for the encapsulation of AAT in ZIF-8. Upon release of the biotherapeutic from the composite, the trypsin inhibitor function of AAT was preserved."
Cause-and-effect analysis as a tool to improve the reproducibility of nanobioassays: four case studies,"One of the challenges in using in vitro data to understand the potential risks of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) is that results often differ or are even contradictory among studies. While it is recognized that numerous factors can influence results produced by nanobioassays, there has not yet been a consistently used conceptual framework to identify key sources of variability in these assays. In this paper, we use cause-and-effect analysis to systematically describe sources of variability in four key in vitro nanobioassays: the 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein assay, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for measuring interleukin-8, a flow cytometry assay (Annexin V/propidium iodide), and the Comet assay. These assays measure end points that can occur in cells impacted by ENMs through oxidative stress, a principle mechanism for ENM toxicity. The results from this analysis identify control measurements to test for potential artifacts or biases that could occur during conduct of these assays with ENMs. Cause-and-effect analysis also reveals additional measurements that could be performed either in preliminary experiments or each time the assay is run to increase confidence in the assay results and their reproducibility within and among laboratories. The approach applied here with these four assays can be used to support the development of a broad range of nanobioassays."
Effects of NH<inf>3</inf> and alkaline metals on the formation of particulate sulfate and nitrate in wintertime Beijing,"Sulfate and nitrate from secondary reactions remain as the most abundant inorganic species in atmospheric particle matter (PM). Their formation is initiated by oxidation (either in gas phase or particle phase), followed by neutralization reaction primarily by NH3, or by other alkaline species such as alkaline metal ions if available. The different roles of NH3 and metal ions in neutralizing H2SO4 or HNO3, however, are seldom investigated. Here we conducted semi-continuous measurements of SO42−, NO3−, NH4+, and their gaseous precursors, as well as alkaline metal ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) in wintertime Beijing. Analysis of aerosol acidity (estimated from a thermodynamic model) indicated that preferable sulfate formation was related to low pH conditions, while high pH conditions promote nitrate formation. Data in different mass fraction ranges of alkaline metal ions showed that in some ranges the role of NH3 was replaced by alkaline metal ions in the neutralization reaction of H2SO4 and HNO3 to form particulate SO42− and NO3−. The relationships between mass fractions of SO42− and NO3− in those ranges of different alkaline metal ion content also suggested that alkaline metal ions participate in the competing neutralization reaction of sulfate and nitrate. The implication of the current study is that in some regions the chemistry to incorporate sulfur and nitrogen into particle phase might be largely affected by desert/fugitive dust and sea salt, besides NH3. This implication is particularly relevant in coastal China and those areas with strong influence of dust storm in the North China Plain (NCP), both of which host a number of megacities with deteriorating air quality."
A nano-based thermotherapy for cancer stem cell-targeted therapy,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) exhibit high resistance to conventional therapy and are responsible for cancer metastasis and tumor relapse. Therefore, it is of significance to develop effective novel strategies to target CSCs for cancer therapies. The challenges associated with developing novel strategies include specific CSC targeting and overcoming their therapeutic resistance. In the present review, we summarize the various strategies for CSC-targeted cancer thermotherapy and combinational therapy, and the potential challenges and prospects for future work in this emerging field."
Adsorption and oxidation of SO<inf>2</inf> on the surface of TiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles: The role of terminal hydroxyl and oxygen vacancy-Ti<sup>3+</sup> states,"Herein, the absorption and oxidation reactions of SO2 on TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) at 296 K under various environmental conditions (humidity, UV irradiation, and ozone copresence) were investigated by using a flow chamber reaction system, synchrotron X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and high resolution synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The results showed that oxidation of SO2 to sulfate via TiO2 NP catalysis happened at a very rapid rate. The appropriate relative humidity, UV irradiation and co-presence of ozone all markedly promoted SO2 oxidation on TiO2 NPs. High resolution XPS unraveled that the terminal hydroxyl (OHt) and oxygen vacancy (VO)-Ti3+ states on TiO2 NPs were the active sites for SO2 adsorption and oxidation. The data of XPS measurements suggest that SO2 was adsorbed on a OHt next to a Ti3+ VO and reacted to form HSO3-. HSO3- can then transform into SO32-via transfer of a proton. The resulting adsorbed SO32- could bind to a surface bridging O (Ob) atom and transform into SO42-. A H2O molecule could dissociate on VO-Ti3+ into two bridging hydroxyl (OHb) groups, subsequently forming new Ob, which provides an active O site for the adsorbed HSO3-/SO32- and oxidizes them into HSO4-/SO42- on the surface of the TiO2 NPs. The copresence of O3 could promote H2O dissociation into OHb, promoting the formation of Ob. The copresence of O3 may also promote the dissociation of adsorbed H2O into TiO2-O2- and hydroxyl radicals (OH) on VOs, facilitating the oxidation of adsorbed HSO3-/SO32-. Under UV irradiation, new VOs were created via oxidation of lattice O by photo-generated holes, resulting in increased Ob and subsequently enhanced oxidation of adsorbed HSO3-/SO32- on TiO2 NPs."
Assessment of Air Pollutant PM2.5 Pulmonary Exposure Using a 3D Lung-on-Chip Model,"Airborne particulate matters have posed significant risk to human health worldwide. Fine particulate matters (PM2.5, aerodynamic diameter <2.5 μm) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality attributed to pulmonary diseases. An advanced in vitro model would benefit the assessment of PM2.5 induced pulmonary injuries and drug development. In this work, we present a PM2.5 exposure model to evaluate the pulmonary risk of fine particulate matter exposure in an organotypic manner with the help of 3D human lung-on-a-chip. By compartmentalized co-culturing of human endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and extra cellular matrix, our lung-on-a-chip recapitulated the structural features of the alveolar-blood barrier, which is pivotal for exogenous hazard toxicity evaluation. PM2.5 was applied to the channel lined with lung epithelial cells to model the pulmonary exposure of fine particulate matter. The results indicated acute high dose PM2.5 exposure would lead to various malfunctions of the alveolar-capillary barrier, including adheren junction disruption, increased ROS generation, apoptosis, inflammatory biofactor expression in epithelial cells and endothelial cells, elevated permeability, and monocyte attachments. Collectively, our lung-on-a-chip model provides a simple platform to investigate the complex responses after PM2.5 exposure in a physiologically relevant level, which could be of great potential in environmental risk assessment and therapeutic treatment development."
Enhanced type i photoreaction of indocyanine green: Via electrostatic-force-driven aggregation,"Owing to the strong NIR absorbance, indocyanine green (ICG) has attracted new attention in emerging photo-theranostics. However, ICG has a very low ROS production efficiency and mainly works through the type II photoreaction via its monomer. The aggregation tendency of ICG in aqueous milieus further worsens the scenario. Herein, ICG aggregates show an enhanced type I photoreaction pathway and have much better photooxidizing capability than its monomer, which improves the performance of ICG in the photodynamic inactivation of bacteria. This finding provides a feasible way to tackle the contradiction of ROS generation and ICG aggregation. Finally, the photodynamic effect of ICG aggregates was combined with the photothermal effect of gold nanorods to achieve an effective treatment of bacterial infection."
Modulated podosome patterning in osteoclasts by fullerenol nanoparticles disturbs the bone resorption for osteoporosis treatment,"Overactivation and excessive differentiation of osteoclasts (OCs) has been implicated in the course of bone metabolism-related diseases. Although fullerenol nanoparticles (fNPs) have been suggested to inhibit OC differentiation and OC function in our previous work, systemic studies on the effect of fNPs on bone diseases, e.g., osteoporosis (OP), in vivo remain elusive. Herein, it is demonstrated that fNPs significantly suppress the differentiation of OCs that derived from the murine bone marrow monocytes and inhibit the formation of the sealing zone by blocking the formation and patterning of podosomes in OCs spatiotemporally. In vivo, fNPs are supposed to be an efficient inhibitor of the overactivation of OCs in a LPS-induced bone erosion mouse model. The therapeutic effect of fNPs on osteoporosis is also investigated in an ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis rat model. The well-organized trabecular bone, the reduction in the number of TRAP positive cells, the improvement of bone-associated parameters, and the mechanical properties all demonstrate that fNPs, similar to diphosphonates, can be a promising candidate for the effective treatment of osteoporosis."
Rapid and Visual Detection of Bipyridylium Herbicides Based on Polyelectrolyte-Induced Nanoassemblies of Pyrenyl Probes,"In this work, we report a novel fluorimetric sensing system for the visual and rapid detection of bipyridylium herbicides (paraquat and diquat) using a polyelectrolyte-induced nanoassembly strategy in 100% aqueous media. This approach relies on the formation of supramolecular assemblies between a pyrenyl probe (N,N,N-trimethyl-4-(pyren-1-yl)butan-1-aminium bromide, PyBTA) and a polyelectrolyte (poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid), PSS), which could promote paraquat complexation by the synergy of noncovalent forces such as electrostatic and π-πstacking interactions. Compared with the traditional direct recognition method, the proposed method shows a 500-fold higher sensitivity, and the detection limit is as low as 40 nM. This assay can be performed within 15 s and can be observed by the naked eye with a visual detection limit of 0.5 μM. Excellent selectivity for paraquat and diquat is demonstrated by a comparison with other pesticides and common ions. This method can be applied to monitor paraquat concentrations in vegetable and soil samples. This approach was validated by paraquat spiking experiments at multiple levels (recovery: 101.2%-104.1%; relative standard deviation (RSD): 2.3%-6.1%; uncertainty: 0.014-0.035). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pyrenyl nanoassembly system constructed for detecting bipyridylium herbicides in aqueous solution. We believe the present work will not only broaden the scope of polyelectrolyte-induced nanoassembly based sensors but also provide important information for the design of novel synergistic methods for rapid detection technology."
Responsible research and innovation: hopes and fears in the scientific community in Europe,"We conducted interviews among some 80 researchers and research executives on their understanding of and their attitudes toward ‘Responsible Research and Innovation’ (RRI). The relevant notion of RRI concerns granting influence on research projects to the general public and stakeholders (‘science with society’), for one, or focusing research on the common good (‘science for society’), for another. We identified a welcoming attitude regarding RRI in the scientific community, but also worries that should be heeded in any effort to implement RRI. Concerns arise with respect to fears of ignorance and bias of societal agents, the loss of the autonomy of science, the neglect of basic research by RRI procedures, the difficulty to anticipate research outcomes and their social impact as well as the additional expenditure required by engaging with societal actors. Such worries provide information about obstacles in the scientific community and thus suggest ways of structuring acceptable RRI schemes."

A biomimetic platelet based on assembling peptides initiates artificial coagulation,"Platelets play a critical role in the regulation of coagulation, one of the essential processes in life, attracting great attention. However, mimicking platelets for in vivo artificial coagulation is still a great challenge due to the complexity of the process. Here, we design platelet-like nanoparticles (pNPs) based on self-assembled peptides that initiate coagulation and form clots in blood vessels. The pNPs first bind specifically to a membrane glycoprotein (i.e., CD105) overexpressed on angiogenetic endothelial cells in the tumor site and simultaneously transform into activated platelet-like nanofibers (apNFs) through ligand-receptor interactions. Next, the apNFs expose more binding sites and recruit and activate additional pNPs, forming artificial clots in both phantom and animal models. The pNPs are proven to be safe in mice without systemic coagulation. The self-assembling peptides mimic platelets and achieve artificial coagulation in vivo, thus providing a promising therapeutic strategy for tumors."

Rethinking Nanosafety: Harnessing Progress and Driving Innovation,
MicroRNA response and toxicity of potential pathways in human colon cancer cells exposed to titanium dioxide nanoparticles,"Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) are widely used for biomedical and food applications, the toxicity of TiO2-NPs in vivo and in vitro has been elucidated, but the underlying cytotoxicity of TiO2-NPs against microRNA remains largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to analyze microRNA profiling induced by TiO2-NPs against NCM460 and HCT116 cell lines. Comparative analysis identified 34 and 24 microRNAs were significantly altered in the TiO2-NPs treated cells at concentrations of 3 and 30 μg/mL, respectively. Functional classification demonstrated that a large proportion of genes involved in metabolism, human disease, and environmental information process were significantly upregulated by TiO2-NPs. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that microRNA 378 might be an early indicator of cellular response to exogenous stimuli with apoptotic signals. Furthermore, TiO2-NPs significantly altered the expression of microRNA 378b and 378g in HCT116 and NCM460 cell lines at different concentrations from 3 to 6 μg/mL. These concentrations elicit high-sensitivity of stimuli response in colon cancer cells when exposed to the slight doses of TiO2-NPs. Our study indicated that microRNAs 378b and 378g may play an important role in TiO2-NPs-mediated colonic cytotoxicity, which may provide a valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of potential risks in colitis and colon cancer."
A biomimetic peptide recognizes and traps bacteria in vivo as human defensin-6,"Using broad-spectrum antibiotics for microbial infection may cause flora disequilibrium, drug-resistance, etc., seriously threatening human health. Here, we design a human defensin-6 mimic peptide (HDMP) that inhibits bacterial invasion in vivo through mimicking the mechanisms of human defensin-6 with high efficiency and precision. The HDMP with ligand and self-assembling peptide sequence recognizes bacteria through ligand-receptor interactions and subsequently traps bacteria by an in situ adaptive self-assembly process and resulting nanofibrous networks; these trapped bacteria are unable to invade host cells. In four animal infection models, the infection rate was markedly decreased. Notably, administration of HDMP (5 mg/kg) nanoparticles increased the survival rate of mice with methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia by as much as 100%, even more than that of vancomycin treatment (5 mg/kg, 83.3%)–treated group, the golden standard of antibiotics. This biomimetic peptide shows great potential as a precise and highly efficient antimicrobial agent."
Malignant pleural mesothelioma: Genetic and microenviromental heterogeneity as an unexpected reading frame and therapeutic challenge,"Mesothelioma is a malignancy of serosal membranes including the peritoneum, pleura, pericardium and the tunica vaginalis of the testes. Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a rare disease with a global incidence in countries like Italy of about 1.15 per 100,000 inhabitants. Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) is the most common form of mesothelioma, accounting for approximately 80% of disease. Although rare in the global population, mesothelioma is linked to industrial pollutants and mineral fiber exposure, with approximately 80% of cases linked to asbestos. Due to the persistent asbestos exposure in many countries, a worldwide progressive increase in MPM incidence is expected for the current and coming years. The tumor grows in a loco-regional pattern, spreading from the parietal to the visceral pleura and invading the surrounding structures that induce the clinical picture of pleural effusion, pain and dyspnea. Distant spreading and metastasis are rarely observed, and most patients die from the burden of the primary tumor. Currently, there are no effective treatments for MPM, and the prognosis is invariably poor. Some studies average the prognosis to be roughly one-year after diagnosis. The uniquely poor mutational landscape which characterizes MPM appears to derive from a selective pressure operated by the environment; thus, inflammation and immune response emerge as key players in driving MPM progression and represent promising therapeutic targets. Here we recapitulate current knowledge on MPM with focus on the emerging network between genetic asset and inflammatory microenvironment which characterize the disease as amenable target for novel therapeutic approaches."
Addressing Nanomaterial Immunosafety by Evaluating Innate Immunity across Living Species,"The interaction of a living organism with external foreign agents is a central issue for its survival and adaptation to the environment. Nanosafety should be considered within this perspective, and it should be examined that how different organisms interact with engineered nanomaterials (NM) by either mounting a defensive response or by physiologically adapting to them. Herein, the interaction of NM with one of the major biological systems deputed to recognition of and response to foreign challenges, i.e., the immune system, is specifically addressed. The main focus is innate immunity, the only type of immunity in plants, invertebrates, and lower vertebrates, and that coexists with adaptive immunity in higher vertebrates. Because of their presence in the majority of eukaryotic living organisms, innate immune responses can be viewed in a comparative context. In the majority of cases, the interaction of NM with living organisms results in innate immune reactions that eliminate the possible danger with mechanisms that do not lead to damage. While in some cases such interaction may lead to pathological consequences, in some other cases beneficial effects can be identified."
Human exposure to synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) is generally negligible as compared to natural compounds with higher or comparable endocrine activity. How to evaluate the risk of the S-EDCs?,"Theoretically, both synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) and natural (exogenous and endogenous) endocrine disrupting chemicals (N-EDCs) can interact with endocrine receptors and disturb hormonal balance. However, compared to endogenous hormones, S-EDCs are only weak partial agonists with receptor affinities several orders of magnitude lower than S-EDCs. Thus, to elicit observable effects, S-EDCs require considerably higher concentrations to attain sufficient receptor occupancy or to displace natural hormones and other endogenous ligands. Significant exposures to exogenous N-EDCs may result from ingestion of foods such as soy-based diets, green tea and sweet mustard. While their potencies are lower as compared to natural endogenous hormones, they usually are considerably more potent than S-EDCs. Effects of exogenous N-EDCs on the endocrine system were observed at high dietary intakes. A causal relation between their mechanism of action and these effects is established and biologically plausible. In contrast, the assumption that the much lower human exposures to S-EDCs may induce observable endocrine effects is not plausible. Hence, it is not surprising that epidemiological studies searching for an association between S-EDC exposure and health effects have failed. Regarding testing for potential endocrine effects, a scientifically justified screen should use in vitro tests to compare potencies of S-EDCs with those of reference N-EDCs. When the potency of the S-EDC is similar or smaller than that of the N-EDC, further testing in laboratory animals and regulatory consequences are not warranted."
Continued Efforts on Nanomaterial-Environmental Health and Safety Is Critical to Maintain Sustainable Growth of Nanoindustry,"Nanotechnology is enjoying an impressive growth and the global nanotechnology industry is expected to exceed US$ 125 billion by 2024. Based on these successes, there are notions that enough is known and efforts on engineered nanomaterial environmental health and safety (nano-EHS) research should be put on the back burner. However, there are recent events showing that it is not the case. The US Food and Drug Administration found ferumoxytol (carbohydrate-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle) for anemia treatment could induce lethal anaphylactic reactions. The European Union will categorize TiO2 as a category 2 carcinogen due to its inhalation hazard and France banned use of TiO2 (E171) in food from January 1, 2020 because of its carcinogenic potential. Although nanoindustry is seemingly in a healthy state, growth could be hindered for the lack of certainty and more nano-EHS research is needed for the sustainable growth of nanoindustry. Herein, the current knowledge gaps and the way forward are elaborated."
The Nano–Intestine Interaction: Understanding the Location-Oriented Effects of Engineered Nanomaterials in the Intestine,"Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are used in food additives, food packages, and therapeutic purposes owing to their useful properties, Therefore, human beings are orally exposed to exogenous nanomaterials frequently, which means the intestine is one of the primary targets of nanomaterials. Consequently, it is of great importance to understand the interaction between nanomaterials and the intestine. When nanomaterials enter into gut lumen, they inevitably interact with various components and thereby display different effects on the intestine based on their locations; these are known as location-oriented effects (LOE). The intestinal LOE confer a new biological-effect profile for nanomaterials, which is dependent on the involvement of the following biological processes: nano–mucus interaction, nano–intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) interaction, nano–immune interaction, and nano–microbiota interaction. A deep understanding of NM-induced LOE will facilitate the design of safer NMs and the development of more efficient nanomedicine for intestine-related diseases. Herein, recent progress in this field is reviewed in order to better understand the LOE of nanomaterials. The distant effects of nanomaterials coupling with microbiota are also highlighted. Investigation of the interaction of nanomaterials with the intestine will stimulate other new research areas beyond intestinal nanotoxicity."
"Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles: Advances in Biodistribution, Toxicity, and Preclinical Exploration","Antioxidant nanoparticles have recently gained tremendous attention for their enormous potential in biomedicine. However, discrepant reports of either medical benefits or toxicity, and lack of reproducibility of many studies, generate uncertainties delaying their effective implementation. Herein, the case of cerium oxide is considered, a well-known catalyst in the petrochemistry industry and one of the first antioxidant nanoparticles proposed for medicine. Like other nanoparticles, it is now described as a promising therapeutic alternative, now as threatening to health. Sources of these discrepancies and how this analysis helps to overcome contradictions found for other nanoparticles are summarized and discussed. For the context of this analysis, what has been reported in the liver is reviewed, where many diseases are related to oxidative stress. Since well-dispersed nanoparticles passively accumulate in liver, it represents a major testing field for the study of new nanomedicines and their clinical translation. Even more, many contradictory works have reported in liver either cerium-oxide-associated toxicity or protection against oxidative stress and inflammation. Based on this, finally, the intention is to propose solutions to design improved nanoparticles that will work more precisely in medicine and safely in society."
Surface carboxylation or PEGylation decreases CuO nanoparticles’ cytotoxicity to human cells in vitro without compromising their antibacterial properties,"Clinical use of CuO nanoparticles (NPs) as antibacterials can be hampered by their toxicity to human cells. We hypothesized that certain surface functionalizations of CuO NPs may render NPs toxic to bacteria, but still be relatively harmless to human cells. To control this hypothesis, the toxicity of differently functionalized CuO NPs to bacteria Escherichia coli vs human cells (THP-1 macrophages and HACAT keratinocytes) was compared using similar conditions and end points. CuO NPs functionalized with polyethylene glycol (CuO–PEG), carboxyl (CuO–COOH, anionic), ammonium (CuO–NH4+, cationic) and unfunctionalized CuO NPs and CuSO4 (controls) were tested. In general, the toxicity of Cu compounds decreased in the following order: CuO–NH4+ > unfunctionalized CuO > CuSO4 > CuO–COOH > CuO–PEG. Positively charged unfunctionalized CuO and especially CuO–NH4+ proved most toxic (24-h EC50 = 21.7–47 mg/l) and had comparable toxicity to bacterial and mammalian cells. The multivariate analysis revealed that toxicity of these NPs was mostly attributed to their positive zeta potential, small hydrodynamic size, high Cu dissolution, and induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and TNF-α. In contrast, CuO–COOH and CuO–PEG NPs had lower toxicity to human cells compared to bacteria despite efficient uptake of these NPs by human cells. In addition, these NPs did not induce TNF-α and ROS. Thus, by varying the NP functionalization and Cu form (soluble salt vs NPs), it was possible to “target” the toxicity of Cu compounds, whereas carboxylation and PEGylation rendered CuO NPs that were more toxic to bacteria than to human cells envisaging their use in medical antibacterial products."
Chemical and Colloidal Dynamics of MnO<inf>2</inf> Nanosheets in Biological Media Relevant for Nanosafety Assessment,"Many layered crystal phases can be exfoliated or assembled into ultrathin 2D nanosheets with novel properties not achievable by particulate or fibrous nanoforms. Among these 2D materials are manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanosheets, which have applications in batteries, catalysts, and biomedical probes. A novel feature of MnO2 is its sensitivity to chemical reduction leading to dissolution and Mn2+ release. Biodissolution is critical for nanosafety assessment of 2D materials, but the timing and location of MnO2 biodissolution in environmental or occupational exposure scenarios are poorly understood. This work investigates the chemical and colloidal dynamics of MnO2 nanosheets in biological media for environmental and human health risk assessment. MnO2 nanosheets are insoluble in most aqueous phases, but react with strong and weak reducing agents in biological fluid environments. In vitro, reductive dissolution can be slow enough in cell culture media for MnO2 internalization by cells in the form of intact nanosheets, which localize in vacuoles, react to deplete intracellular glutathione, and induce cytotoxicity that is likely mediated by intracellular Mn2+ release. The results are used to classify MnO2 nanosheets within a new hazard screening framework for 2D materials, and the implications of MnO2 transformations for nanotoxicity testing and nanosafety assessment are discussed."
When Would Immunologists Consider a Nanomaterial to be Safe? Recommendations for Planning Studies on Nanosafety,"The immune system is professional in recognizing and responding to non-self, including nanomaterials. Immune responses by professional and nonprofessional immune cells are thus nearly inevitable upon exposure of cells and organisms to such materials. The state of research into taking the immune system into account in nanosafety studies is reviewed and three aspects in which further improvements are desirable are identified: 1) Due to technical limitations, more stringent testing for endotoxin contamination should be made. 2) Since under overdose conditions immunity shows unphysiological responses, all doses used should be justified by being equivalent to tissue-delivered doses. 3) When markers of acute inflammation or cell stress are observed, functional assays are necessary to distinguish between homeostatic fluctuation and genuine defensive or tolerogenic responses. Since immune activation can also indicate that the immune system considers a stimulus to be harmless and induces tolerance, activation markers by themselves do not necessarily imply a danger to the body. Guidelines such as these are necessary to approach the point where specific nanomaterials are classified as safe based on reliable testing strategies."
The Nanomaterial Metabolite Corona Determined Using a Quantitative Metabolomics Approach: A Pilot Study,"Nanomaterials (NMs) are promptly coated with biomolecules in biological systems leading to the formation of the so-called corona. To date, research has predominantly focused on the protein corona and how it affects NM uptake, distribution, and bioactivity by conferring a biological identity to NMs enabling interactions with receptors to mediate cellular responses. Thus, protein corona studies are now integral to nanosafety assessment. However, a larger class of molecules, the metabolites, which are orders of magnitude smaller than proteins (<1000 Da) and regulate metabolic pathways, has been largely overlooked. This hampers the understanding of the bio–nano interface, development of computational predictions of corona formation, and investigations into uptake or toxicity at the cellular level, including identification of molecular initiating events triggering adverse outcome pathways. Here, a capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry based metabolomics approach reveals that pure polar ionogenic metabolite standards differentially adsorb to a range of 6 NMs (SiO2, 3 TiO2 with different surface chemistries, and naïve and carboxylated polystyrene NMs). The metabolite corona composition is quantitatively compared using protein-free and complete plasma samples, revealing that proteins in samples significantly change the composition of the metabolite corona. This key finding provides the basis to include the metabolite corona in future nanosafety endeavors."
Next-Generation Sequencing Reveals Differential Responses to Acute versus Long-Term Exposures to Graphene Oxide in Human Lung Cells,"Numerous studies have addressed the biological impact of graphene-based materials including graphene oxide (GO), yet few have focused on long-term effects. Here, RNA sequencing is utilized to unearth responses of human lung cells to GO. To this end, the BEAS-2B cell line derived from normal human bronchial epithelium is subjected to repeated, low-dose exposures of GO (1 or 5 µg mL−1) for 28 days or to the equivalent, cumulative amount of GO for 48 h. Then, samples are analyzed by using the NovaSeq 6000 sequencing system followed by pathway analysis and gene ontology enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes. Significant differences are seen between the low-dose, long-term exposures and the high-dose, short-term exposures. Hence, exposure to GO for 48 h results in mitochondrial dysfunction. In contrast, exposure to GO for 28 days is characterized by engagement of apoptosis pathways with downregulation of genes belonging to the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family. Validation experiments confirm that long-term exposure to GO affects the apoptosis threshold in lung cells, accompanied by a loss of IAPs. These studies reveal the sensitivity of RNA-sequencing approaches and show that acute exposure to GO is not a good predictor of the long-term effects of GO."
Environmental Hazard Potential of Nano-Photocatalysts Determined by Nano-Bio Interactions and Exposure Conditions,"Nano-photocatalysts are known for their ability to degrade pollutants or perform water splitting catalyzed by light. Being the key functional ingredients of current and future products, the potential of nano-photocatalysts releasing into the environment and causing unintended harm to living organisms warrants investigation. Risk assessment of these materials serves as an important step to allow safe implementation and to avoid irrational fear. Using TiO2 and g-C3N4 as representative nano-photocatalysts, this study evaluates their hazard potential in zebrafish. Under simulated solar light, nano-photocatalysts up to 100 mg L−1 show no acute toxicity to zebrafish embryos due to the protection of chorions. The short-lived reactive oxygen species generated by nano-photocatalysts only exert injury to the hatched larvae at and above 50 mg L−1. The input of solar energy, determined by the depth of water, irradiation time, and light intensity, greatly influences the toxicity outcome. Increasing concentrations of natural organic matters contribute positively to the hazard potential at 0–10 mg L−1 while gradually diminishing the hazardous effect above 10 mg L−1. This study demonstrates the importance of nano-bio interactions and environmental exposure conditions in determining the safety profile of nano-photocatalysts."
Metal–Organic Framework Nanoparticles Induce Pyroptosis in Cells Controlled by the Extracellular pH,"Ion homeostasis is essential for cellular survival, and elevated concentrations of specific ions are used to start distinct forms of programmed cell death. However, investigating the influence of certain ions on cells in a controlled way has been hampered due to the tight regulation of ion import by cells. Here, it is shown that lipid-coated iron-based metal–organic framework nanoparticles are able to deliver and release high amounts of iron ions into cells. While high concentrations of iron often trigger ferroptosis, here, the released iron induces pyroptosis, a form of cell death involving the immune system. The iron release occurs only in slightly acidic extracellular environments restricting cell death to cells in acidic microenvironments and allowing for external control. The release mechanism is based on endocytosis facilitated by the lipid-coating followed by degradation of the nanoparticle in the lysosome via cysteine-mediated reduction, which is enhanced in slightly acidic extracellular environment. Thus, a new functionality of hybrid nanoparticles is demonstrated, which uses their nanoarchitecture to facilitate controlled ion delivery into cells. Based on the selectivity for acidic microenvironments, the described nanoparticles may also be used for immunotherapy: the nanoparticles may directly affect the primary tumor and the induced pyroptosis activates the immune system."
"Effects of Ceria Nanoparticles and CeCl<inf>3</inf> on Plant Growth, Biological and Physiological Parameters, and Nutritional Value of Soil Grown Common Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris)","The release of metal ions may play an important role in toxicity of metal-based nanoparticles. In this report, a life cycle study is carried out in a greenhouse, to compare the effects of ceria nanoparticles (NPs) and Ce3+ ions at 0, 50, 100, and 200 mg Ce kg−1 on plant growth, biological and physiological parameters, and nutritional value of soil-grown common bean plants. Ceria NPs have a tendency to negatively affect photosynthesis, but the effect is not statistically significant. Ce3+ ionic treatments at 50, 100, and 200 mg Ce kg−1 result in increases of 1.25-, 0.66-, and 1.20-fold in stomatal conductance, respectively, relative to control plants. Both ceria NPs and Ce3+ ions disturb the homeostasis of antioxidant defense system in the plants, but only 200 mg Ce kg−1 ceria NPs significantly induce lipid peroxidation in the roots. Ceria NP treatments tend to reduced fresh weight and to increase mineral contents of the green pods, but have no effect on the organic nutrient contents. On the contrary, Ce3+ ion treatments modify the organic compositions and thus alter the nutritional quality and flavor of the green pods. These results suggest that the two Ce forms may have different mechanisms on common bean plants."
All Roads Lead to the Liver: Metal Nanoparticles and Their Implications for Liver Health,"Metal nanoparticles (NPs) are frequently encountered in daily life, and concerns have been raised about their toxicity and safety. Among which, they naturally accumulate in the liver after introduction into the body, independent of the route of administration. Some NPs exhibit intrinsic pharmaceutical effects that are related to their physical parameters, and their inadvertent accumulation in the liver can exert strong effects on liver function and structure. Even as such physiological consequences are often categorically dismissed as toxic and deleterious, there are cell type-specific and NP-specific biological responses that elicit distinctive pharmacological consequences that can be harnessed for good. By limiting the scope of discussion to metallic NPs, this work attempts to provide a balanced perspective on their safety in the liver, and discusses both possible therapeutic benefits and potential accidental liver damage arising from their interaction with specific parenchymal and nonparenchymal cell types in the liver."
The challenge and prospect of mRNA therapeutics landscape,"Messenger RNA (mRNA)-based therapeutics hold the potential to cause a major revolution in the pharmaceutical industry because they can be used for precise and individualized therapy, and enable patients to produce therapeutic proteins in their own bodies without struggling with the comprehensive manufacturing issues associated with recombinant proteins. Compared with the current therapeutics, the production of mRNA is much cost-effective, faster and more flexible because it can be easily produced by in vitro transcription, and the process is independent of mRNA sequence. Moreover, mRNA vaccines allow people to develop personalized medications based on sequencing results and/or personalized conditions rapidly. Along with the great potential from bench to bedside, technical obstacles facing mRNA pharmaceuticals are also obvious. The stability, immunogenicity, translation efficiency, and delivery are all pivotal issues need to be addressed. In the recently published research results, these issues are gradually being overcome by state-of-the-art development technologies. In this review, we describe the structural properties and modification technologies of mRNA, summarize the latest advances in developing mRNA delivery systems, review the preclinical and clinical applications, and put forward our views on the prospect and challenges of developing mRNA into a new class of drug."
"Nanoparticle exposure and hazard in the ceramic industry: an overview of potential sources, toxicity and health effects","The ceramic industry is an industrial sector of great impact in the global economy that has been benefiting from advances in materials and processing technologies. Ceramic manufacturing has a strong potential for airborne particle formation and emission, namely of ultrafine particles (UFP) and nanoparticles (NP), meaning that workers of those industries are at risk of potential exposure to these particles. At present, little is known on the impact of engineered nanoparticles (ENP) on the environment and human health and no established Occupational Exposure Limits (OEL) or specific regulations to airborne nanoparticles (ANP) exposure exist raising concerns about the possible consequences of such exposure. In this paper, we provide an overview of the current knowledge on occupational exposure to NP in the ceramic industry and their impact on human health. Possible sources and exposure scenarios, a summary of the existing methods for evaluation and monitoring of ANP in the workplace environment and proposed Nano Reference Values (NRV) for different classes of NP are presented. Case studies on occupational exposure to ANP generated at different stages of the ceramic manufacturing process are described. Finally, the toxicological potential of intentional and unintentional ANP that have been identified in the ceramic industry workplace environment is discussed based on the existing evidence from in vitro and in vivo inhalation toxicity studies."
High-Numerical-Aperture Dielectric Metalens for Super-Resolution Focusing of Oblique Incident Light,"Recently, developments in superoscillatory optical devices have allowed for label-free far-field optical super-resolution technology by allowing engineering of optical point-spread functions beyond the traditional Abbe diffraction limit. However, such superoscillatory optical devices are optimized for the normal-incident operation, which inevitably leads to a comparatively slow imaging acquisition rate in the application of super-resolution microscopy. Here, a super-resolution metalens is demonstrated with a high numerical aperture that can focus oblique incident light into a hot spot with a size smaller than the diffraction limit at the visible wavelength. This super-resolution metalens has a numerical aperture of as large as 0.97, a focal length of 38.0 µm, a radius of 151.9 µm, and a field of view of 4° that enables super-resolution focusing on the focal plane at a wavelength of λ = 632.8 nm. In a 5.6λ × 5.6λ field of view on the focal plane, the size of the focal spot is smaller than 0.45λ, which is only 0.874 times the corresponding Abbe diffraction limit. The super-resolution metalens offers a promising way toward fast-scanning label-free far-field super-resolution microscopy."
"Time-Resolved Quantification of Nanoparticle Uptake, Distribution, and Impact in Precision-Cut Liver Slices","Much effort within the nanosafety field is currently focused on the use of advanced in vitro models to reduce the gap between in vitro and in vivo studies. Within this context, precision-cut tissue slices are a unique ex vivo model to investigate nanoparticle impact using live tissue from laboratory animals and even humans. However, several aspects of the basic mechanisms of nanoparticle interactions with tissue have not yet been elucidated. To this end, liver slices are exposed to carboxylated and amino-modified polystyrene known to have a different impact on cells. As observed in standard cell cultures, amino-modified polystyrene nanoparticles induce apoptosis, and their impact is affected by the corona forming on their surface in biological fluids. Subsequently, a detailed time-resolved study of nanoparticle uptake and distribution in the tissue is performed, combining fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry on cells recovered after tissue digestion. As observed in vivo, the Kupffer cells accumulate high nanoparticle amounts and, interestingly, they move within the tissue towards the slice borders. Similar observations are reproduced in liver slices from human tissue. Thus, tissue slices can be used to reproduce ex vivo important features of nanoparticle outcomes in the liver and study nanoparticle impact on real tissue."
A surface convertible nanoplatform with enhanced mitochondrial targeting for tumor photothermal therapy,"Photothermal therapy emerges as a promising approach in antitumor treatment. A major challenge for conventional photothermal therapy is its unselective hyperthermia distribution within tumor tissues, which leads to detrimental effects on surrounding healthy tissues and compromised therapeutic effectiveness. In this study, a targeted photothermal delivery nanoplatform (P-D-CS-CNTs) was facilely fabricated by decoration of an acidity-labile polyethylene glycol (PEG) derivative onto chitosan nanoparticles encapsulating single-walled carbon nanotubes. P-D-CS-CNTs displayed a good stability in serum at normal physiological pH and convertibility of surface charges upon exposure to tumoral acidic pH, which was attributed to the acidity-triggered dePEGylation. The confocal laser scanning microscopic observations suggested that such surface-convertibility of nanoparticles facilitated tumor cell uptake, endo/lyososomal escape, and enhanced mitochondrial targeting. Furthermore, upon irradiation with an 808 nm laser, P-D-CS-CNTs could sabotage mitochondria with mild hyperthermia, which further induced the ROS burst from damaged mitochondria. The overdosed ROS ultimately resulted in mitochondrial damage and cell death. These findings indicate that the surface-convertible nanoplatform is promising for improved photothermal anticancer therapy."
"Heterogeneous surface architectured metal-organic frameworks for cancer therapy, imaging, and biosensing: A state-of-the-art review","With recent progress in inorganic material based nanoplatforms for cancer therapy and imaging, multiple nano vehicles have been developed and evaluated. These recent advancements in material science led to the development of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and nano MOFs (nMOFs) as the potential and versatile delivery platforms for cancer theranostic. With a vast amount of ongoing research on MOFs, various surface architectured MOFs for with variable properties have been developed and tested. The concept of subcellular targeted therapy of cancer has also been employed using MOFs which demonstrated significantly enhanced anticancer therapy. These MOFs have been developed in a way to provide them stimuli-responsive drug release property which can be utilized for externally guided therapy of cancer. Apart from cellular and subcellular targeted platforms and stimuli-responsive platforms, MOFs have also been explored in the field of bioimaging and biosensing. Multiple types of biosensing platforms based on MOFs and nMOFs have been proposed for biosensing of biomolecules related to cancer for sensing and early detection. The bioimaging probes based on MOFs have been employed for multiple diagnostic platforms. The review gives the recent updates for the abovementioned topics along with the toxicity aspects of MOFs for human use. The review overall gives a detailed overview of research done to date in the field of MOFs based nanoplatforms for cancer theranostics."
Bio-inspired micro/nanostructures for flexible and stretchable electronics,"The remarkable ability of biological systems to sense and adapt to complex environmental conditions has inspired the design of next-generation electronics with advanced functionalities. This review focuses on emerging bio-inspired strategies for the development of flexible and stretchable electronics that can accommodate mechanical deformations and integrate seamlessly with biological systems. We will provide an overview of the practical considerations in the materials and structure designs of flexible and stretchable electronics. Recent progress in bio-inspired pressure/strain sensors, stretchable electrodes, mesh electronics, and flexible energy devices are then discussed, with an emphasis on their unconventional micro/nanostructure designs and advanced functionalities. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives are identified and discussed. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
Surface charge-dependent bioaccumulation dynamics of silver nanoparticles in freshwater algae,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) can gradually accumulate in algae to exert their toxicity; however, there is little knowledge about their bioaccumulation dynamics. For the first time, this study reports the effect of surface charge of AgNPs on their bioaccumulation dynamics in freshwater algae (Chlorella vulgaris) using biodynamic modeling. Polyethylene-coated AgNPs (PEI-AgNPs) and citrate-coated AgNPs (Cit-AgNPs) were selected as positively and negatively charged AgNPs, i.e., P-AgNPs and N-AgNPs, respectively. Their uptake and elimination dynamics were investigated at a concentration of 50% inhibition of growth rate values (EC50) and 10% inhibition of growth rate values (EC10). The one-component model can generally well simulate the algal uptake and elimination kinetics of N-AgNPs but not of P-AgNPs. At both concentrations, the uptake rate constants (ku) for P-AgNPs were ∼20 times higher than that for N-AgNPs. The parameters of biphasic elimination kinetics revealed that P-AgNPs were eliminated faster than N-AgNPs during depuration compared to in subsequent processes. Compared with N-AgNPs, extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theory and dark-field imaging revealed that P-AgNPs can be rapidly absorbed on the algal cell surface membrane owing to their remarkably lower energy barrier between algal cells, resulting in a faster adsorption/uptake process and aggregation of algal cells. Our results clearly demonstrate that the AgNPs exhibited surface charge-dependent bioaccumulation dynamics in algal cells. Thus, AgNP surface charge primarily influences the AgNP accumulation dynamics in algal cells."
Dual-channel biosensor for Hg<sup>2+</sup> sensing in food using Au@Ag/graphene-upconversion nanohybrids as metal-enhanced fluorescence and SERS indicators,"Here, we proposed a novel dual-channel biosensor for rapid and sensitive detection of Hg2+. Compared with the previous biosensors, the Au@Ag/graphene-upconversion (Au@Ag-GU) was prepared via a facile method and acted as a versatile signal indicator that can simultaneously readout surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and fluorescence signals for Hg2+detection. In this strategy, the core shell magnetite colloid nanocrystal clusters-polymethacrylic acid magnetic beads (MCNCs/PMAA MBs) were synthesized and conjugated with aptamer to specific capture the Hg2+. The dual-channel biosensor was thus fabricated by immobilizing the Au@Ag-GU onto the surface of MBs through the complementary pairing of aptamer and complementary DNA (cDNA). Upon Hg2+ incubation, Hg2+ preferably bound to the MBs-aptamer, resulting in the subsequent release of preloaded cDNA-Au@Ag-GU into supernatants. Under magnetic attraction, the MBs-aptamer was accumulated immediately, resulting in the concentration of Hg2+ become homodromous proportional to the dual channel intensity of the supernatants. Under the optimized conditions, the dual channel biosensor achieved excellent performances for Hg2+ with limits of detection (LOD) of 0.33 and 1 ppb, respectively. Furthermore, the feasibility of the biosensor to qualify Hg2+was also established in spiked tap water and milk samples. This strategy may provide a bridge between a highly sensitive fluorescence assay and a rapid SERS assay, it can broaden the applicability of Hg2+ detection, which can be easy to detect Hg2+ in real samples by coupling with SERS or fluorescence assay."
Nanomaterials in the Environment Acquire an “Eco-Corona” Impacting their Toxicity to Daphnia Magna—a Call for Updating Toxicity Testing Policies,"Nanomaterials (NMs) are particles with at least one dimension between 1 and 100 nm and a large surface area to volume ratio, providing them with exceptional qualities that are exploited in a variety of industrial fields. Deposition of NMs into environmental waters during or after use leads to the adsorption of an ecological (eco-) corona, whereby a layer of natural biomolecules coats the NM changing its stability, identity and ultimately toxicity. The eco-corona is not currently incorporated into ecotoxicity tests, although it has been shown to alter the interactions of NMs with organisms such as Daphnia magna (D. magna). Here, the literature on environmental biomolecule interactions with NMs is synthesized and a framework for understanding the eco-corona composition and its role in modulating NMs ecotoxicity is presented, utilizing D. magna as a model. The importance of including biomolecules as part of the current international efforts to update the standard testing protocols for NMs, is highlighted. Facilitating the formation of an eco-corona prior to NMs ecotoxicity testing will ensure that signaling pathways perturbed by the NMs are real rather than being associated with the damage arising from reactive NM surfaces “acquiring” a corona by pulling biomolecules from the organism's surface."
Au nanoparticles based ultra-fast “Turn-On” fluorescent sensor for detection of biothiols and its application in living cell imaging,"Au or other metal nanostructures have the ability to strongly quench the fluorescence of fluorophores. This feature has made AuNP-conjugates attractive for the construction of platforms for various bioanalytes to overcome the limitations of small molecule fluorophores (poor solubility, long reaction time). In this paper, an ultrafast “Turn-On” fluorescent sensor for biothiols was constructed. The sensor is based on the fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect between the fluorophore (PN) and AuNPs, which effectively quenches the fluorescence of the fluorophore. In the presence of thiols, PN is displaced and released from AuNP surfaces, and thus, the fluorescence is rapidly restored. The sensor features appreciable water solubility and ultrafast response time (a few seconds for Cys). In addition, it exhibits high selectivity and a detection limit as low as 12 nmol/L for Hcy. Moreover, the sensor presents good biocompatibility and has been successfully applied for imaging biothiols in living cells."
Modulating the tumor microenvironment with new therapeutic nanoparticles: A promising paradigm for tumor treatment,"To better make nanomedicine entering the clinic, developing new rationally designed nanotherapeutics with a deeper understanding of tumor biology is required. The tumor microenvironment is similar to the inflammatory response in a healing wound, the milieu of which promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Successful targeting of the microenvironmental components with effective nanotherapeutics to modulate the tumor microvessels or restore the homeostatic mechanisms in the tumor stroma will offer new hope for cancer treatment. We here highlight the progress in constructing nanotherapeutics to target or modulate the tumor microenvironment. We discuss the factors necessary for nanomedicines to become a new paradigm in cancer therapy, including the selection of drugs and therapeutic targets, controllable synthesis, and tempo-spatial drug release."
Preparation of Lead-free Two-Dimensional-Layered (C<inf>8</inf>H<inf>17</inf>NH<inf>3</inf>)<inf>2</inf>SnBr<inf>4</inf> Perovskite Scintillators and Their Application in X-ray Imaging,"Scintillators, as spectral and energy transformers, are essential for X-ray imaging applications. However, their current disadvantages, including higherature sintering and generation of agglomerated powders or large bulk crystals, may not meet the increasing demands of low cost, nontoxicity, and flexible radiation detection. Thus, improved perovskite scintillators are developed in this research. A hybrid perovskite ((C8H17NH3)2SnBr4), which is nontoxic, lead-free, and organic-inorganic, is developed as a scintillator with good emission performance and radioluminescence intensity. These perovskite scintillators are synthesized at low temperatures in an aqueous acid solution, through which they generate a near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield of 98% with the excitation of ultraviolet light. As far as we know, this work is the first to show that the two-dimensional (2D) (C8H17NH3)2SnBr4 perovskite scintillator films prepared by coating a polymer layer can be applied to an X-ray imaging system. The results demonstrate that the low cost X-ray imaging device with good resolution and performance benefits dramatically from this lead-free organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite film. Therefore, this 2D-layered (C8H17NH3)2SnBr4 perovskite scintillator may be a high potential candidate for scintillating material for X-ray imaging techniques."
Dynamic Detection of Active Enzyme Instructed Supramolecular Assemblies In Situ via Super-Resolution Microscopy,"Inspired by the self-assembly phenomena in nature, the instructed self-assembly of exogenous small molecules in a biological environment has become a prevalent process to control cell fate. Despite mounting examples of versatile bioactivities, the underlying mechanism remains less understood, which is in large hindered by the difficulties in the identification of those dynamic assemblies in situ. Here, with direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, we are able to elucidate the dynamic morphology transformation of the enzyme-instructed supramolecular assemblies in situ inside cancer cells with a resolution below 50 nm. It indicates that the assembling molecules endure drastically different pathways between cell lines with different phosphatase activities and distribution. In HeLa cells, the direct formation of intracellular supramolecular nanofibers showed slight cytotoxicity, which was due to the possible cellular secretory pathway to excrete those exogenous molecules assemblies. In contrast, in Saos-2 cells with active phosphatase on the cell surface, assemblies with granular morphology first formed on the cell membranes, followed by a transformation into nanofibers and accumulation in cells, which induced Saos-2 cell death eventually. Overall, we provided a convenient method to reveal the in situ dynamic nanomorphology transformation of the supramolecular assemblies in a biological environment, in order to decipher their diverse biological activities."
A two-step gas/liquid strategy for the production of N-doped defect-rich transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets and their antibacterial applications,"Herein, we developed a general two-step gas expansion and exfoliation strategy based on a urea-assisted hydrothermal process combined with sonication exfoliation for the production of nitrogen (N)-doped plus defect-rich transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanosheets (NSs) such as N-MoS2 and N-WS2 NSs. The interlayers of bulk MoS2 (or WS2) were expanded with urea molecules dissolved in distilled water, which were decomposed to NH3 during the hydrothermal process. Simultaneously, sulfur atoms were partly replaced by N atoms to achieve N doping. Subsequently, sonication exfoliation of the urea-treated bulk MoS2 (or WS2) promoted the production of defect-rich NSs. Importantly, the defect-rich N-MoS2 and N-WS2 NSs exhibit enhanced peroxidase-like catalytic activity after being captured by bacteria, and can catalyze hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce more toxic hydroxyl radicals (OH) than non-N-doped MoS2 or WS2 NSs. As a result, the N-MoS2 or N-WS2 NSs were capable of effectively killing Gram-negative ampicillin resistant Escherichia coli (AmprE. coli) and Gram-positive endospore-forming Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and promoting bacteria-infected wound healing. This work not only provides a simple, universal exfoliation strategy for producing defect-rich N-doped TMD NSs but also provides a promising catalytic antibacterial option and has potential for many other catalytic applications."
Glutathione-sensitive and folate-targeted nanoparticles loaded with paclitaxel to enhance oral squamous cell carcinoma therapy,"In this study, a drug delivery system based on glutathione (GSH)-sensitive and folic acid (FA)-targeted nanoparticles loaded with paclitaxel (FA-PEG-S-S-PCL@PTX, FA-NPs) was developed. First, we proved that the FA receptor was significantly expressed in 95 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) specimens (57.9%). This provided feasibility to release FA-targeted nanoparticles in tumour sites for patients with OSCC. Next, FA-NPs were synthesized and characterized. In vitro, we found enhancement in FA-mediated endocytosis in the HSC3 cells with FA overexpression. Therefore, paclitaxel (PTX) from FA-NPs could be precisely released due to the disulfide bonds that were cleaved by a redox reaction. In vivo, FA-NPs could be accumulated in mice bearing HSC3 cells, where they exhibited effective antitumor effects when compared to the treatments with free PTX and PEG-S-S-PCL@PTX. In summary, this novel drug system has an opportunity to improve OSCC treatment."
Polypeptide-Templated Au Nanoclusters with Red and Blue Fluorescence Emissions for Multimodal Imaging of Cell Nuclei,"Noble metal nanoclusters (<2 nm) prepared using special molecules such as proteins and peptides as templates have been attracting increasing attention in biomedical applications and cell imaging because of their excellent biocompatibility, size-dependent fluorescence properties, and relatively simple synthesis. Although cell imaging using metal clusters has developed rapidly in recent years, multimodal imaging of the cell nucleus remains challenging. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of two different types of gold nanoclusters, one with blue fluorescence emission (λex 320 nm, λem 405 nm) and the other with red fluorescence emission (λex 560 nm, λem 657 nm), using the same polypeptide SV (sequence: NH2-CCYGGPKKKRKVG-COOH) as a template. The synthesis of these two optically distinct Au nanoclusters (Au NCs) was achieved through the optimization of synthesis conditions, including light, pH, the Au: polypeptide ratio, reaction time, and temperature. The multimodal imaging ability of the Au NCs were subsequently explored, with particular emphasis on the enzyme-like catalysis of the NCs and their use in the optical imaging of cell nuclei. Results show that the Au NCs possessed similar biological activities as the parent peptide used in their synthesis as well as demonstrating peroxidase-like activity due to the Au nanocluster core. Further, the Au NCs targeted the cell nucleus, with their strong fluorescence allowing cell imaging (cells containing Au clusters could be distinguished by eye, eliminating the need for additional labels). Finally, the Au NCs exhibited excellent multimodal cell imaging abilities. The results suggest that the Au NCs introduced here are promising candidates for the labeling and analysis of pathological samples."
Organ burden of inhaled nanoceria in a 2-year low-dose exposure study: dump or depot?,"No detailed information on in vivo biokinetics of CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) following chronic low-dose inhalation is available. The CeO2 burden for lung, lung-associated lymph nodes, and major non-pulmonary organs, blood, and feces, was determined in a chronic whole-body inhalation study in female Wistar rats undertaken according to OECD TG453 (6 h per day for 5 days per week for a 104 weeks with the following concentrations: 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/m3, animals were sacrificed after 3, 12, 24 months). Different spectroscopy methods (ICP-MS, ion-beam-microscopy) were used for the quantification of organ burden and for visualization of NP distribution patterns in tissues. After 24 months of exposure, the highest CeO2 lung burden (4.41 mg per lung) was associated with the highest aerosol concentration and was proportionally lower for the other groups in a dose-dependent manner. Imaging techniques confirmed the presence of CeO2 agglomerates of different size categories within lung tissue with a non-homogenous distribution. For the highest exposure group, after 24 months in total 1.2% of the dose retained in the lung was found in the organs and tissues analyzed in this study, excluding lymph nodes and skeleton. The CeO2 burden per tissue decreased from lungs > lymph nodes > hard bone > liver > bone marrow. For two dosage groups, the liver organ burden showed a low accumulation rate. Here, the liver can be regarded as depot, whereas kidneys, the skeleton, and bone marrow seem to be dumps due to steadily increasing NP burden over time."
Mechanisms for cellular uptake of nanosized clinical MRI contrast agents,"Engineered Nanomaterials (NMs), such as Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIONs), offer significant benefits in a wide range of applications, including cancer diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. However, the use of NMs in biomedicine raises safety concerns due to lack of knowledge on possible biological interactions and effects. The initial basis for using SPIONs as biomedical MRI contrast enhancement agents was the idea that they are selectively taken up by macrophage cells, and not by the surrounding cancer cells. To investigate this claim, we analyzed the uptake of SPIONs into well-established cancer cell models and benchmarked this against a common macrophage cell model. In combination with fluorescent labeling of compartments and siRNA silencing of various proteins involved in common endocytic pathways, the mechanisms of internalization of SPIONs in these cell types has been ascertained utilizing reflectance confocal microscopy. Caveolar mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis are both implicated in SPION uptake into cancer cells, whereas in macrophage cells, a clathrin-dependant route appears to predominate. Colocalization studies confirmed the eventual fate of SPIONs as accumulation in the degradative lysosomes. Dissolution of the SPIONs within the lysosomal environment has also been determined, allowing a fuller understanding of the cellular interactions, uptake, trafficking and effects of SPIONs within a variety of cancer cells and macrophages. Overall, the behavior of SPIONS in non-phagocytotic cell lines is broadly similar to that in the specialist macrophage cells, although some differences in the uptake patterns are apparent."
Metal ions modulation of the self-assembly of short peptide conjugated nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),"Metal ions are essential components that help maintain the processes of normal life, and they can be used to fabricate self-assembled building blocks for peptide derivatives, proteins and nucleic acids. Here, we have developed a novel strategy to construct supramolecular hydrogels modulated using metal cations. Upon introducing a variety of metal ions into aqueous solutions of a gelator (naproxen-FF), including a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and dipeptide, we obtain stable hydrogels under neutral or alkaline conditions. It is found that these hydrogels with three-dimensional nanofiber networks exhibit excellent mechanical properties and thixotropy, as well as superb responsivity to multiple metal ions. Due to the significance of potassium ions in biological processes, the K-triggered hydrogel has been chosen as a model, and its self-assembly mechanism has been explored via various spectral analysis processes. In addition, the self-assembly performances of peptides are significantly affected by the chemical structures of the gelator molecules. This work provides deep insight into the aggregation mechanism of dipeptide-conjugating drug molecules through introducing a variety of metal ions, laying the foundation for further biological applications."
Mechanism of a long-term controlled drug release system based on simple blended electrospun fibers,"Background: Drug delivery systems based on electrospun fibers have been under development for many years. However, studies of controllable long-term drug release from electrospun membrane systems and the underlying release mechanisms have seldom been reported. Methods: In this study, electrospun membrane drug delivery systems consisting of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin hydrochloride and FDA-approved polymers are fabricated. Different second-component polymers are introduced to change the properties of a poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) matrix, thereby altering the drug release behavior. On the basis of observations of morphology, cumulative release profiles, and determinations of release duration, the drug release kinetics and critical characteristics influencing drug release behavior are discussed. Results: It is found that the drug release profiles can be divided into three stages according to the rate of drug release. Stage I is controlled by fiber swelling and diffusion according to Fick's second law. Stage II is controlled by diffusion through a fused membrane structure, which results in very slow drug release. Stage III is controlled by polymer degradation and involves release of the remaining drug. Conclusions: The results of this study of release mechanisms should provide a basis for adjustments of drug release dosage and duration, thereby contributing to the development of drug delivery systems satisfying clinical requirements."
Gd-metallofullerenol drug delivery system mediated macrophage polarization enhances the efficiency of chemotherapy,"Treatment of solid tumors by chemotherapy is usually failed in clinical because of its low effectiveness and side effects. Stimulation of immune system in vivo to fight cancer has been proved to be a pleasant complementary to systemic chemotherapy. Herein, we have developed a combination cancer therapy strategy by using polymer nanoparticles to deliver Gd-metallofullerenol and doxorubicin simultaneously. The Gd-metallofullerenol provoked the Th1 immune response by regulating the M1 macrophage polarization and the doxorubicin realized direct tumor cells killing by its cytotoxic effect. Also, the Gd-metallofullerenol as part of component in delivery system enhances the encapsulation efficiency of doxorubicin in polymer cargo for potential passive tumor target. The biocompatible and reliable method by combining nanoparticle-induced immune modulation and chemotherapy triggers systemic antitumor immune responses for the synergistic inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. The integration of Gd-metallofullerenol and doxorubicin with potentially complementary functions in one nanoplatform may provide new opportunities to improve cancer treatments."
Magnetic Temperature-Sensitive Solid-Lipid Particles for Targeting and Killing Tumor Cells,"Magnetic and temperature-sensitive solid lipid particles (mag. SLPs) were prepared in the presence of oleic acid-coated iron oxide (IO-OA) nanoparticles with 1-tetradecanol and poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(ε-caprolactone) as lipid and stabilizing surfactant-like agents, respectively. The particles, typically ~850 nm in hydrodynamic size, showed heat dissipation under the applied alternating magnetic field. Cytotoxic activity of the mag.SLPs, non-magnetic SLPs, and iron oxide nanoparticles was compared concerning the mammalian cancer cell lines and their drug-resistant counterparts using trypan blue exclusion test and MTT assay. The mag.SLPs exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity against human leukemia cell lines growing in suspension (Jurkat and HL-60/wt), as well as the doxorubicin (Dox)- and vincristine-resistant HL-60 sublines. The mag.SLPs showed higher cytotoxicity toward drug-resistant sublines as compared to Dox. The human glioblastoma cell line U251 growing in a monolayer culture was also sensitive to mag.SLPs cytotoxicity. Staining of U251 cells with the fluorescent dyes Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide (PI) revealed that mag.SLPs treatment resulted in an increased number of cells with condensed chromatin and/or fragmented nuclei as well as with blebbing of the plasma membranes. While the Hoechst 33342 staining of cell suggested the pro-apoptotic activity of the particles, the PI staining indicated the pro-necrotic changes in the target cells. These conclusions were confirmed by Western blot analysis of apoptosis-related proteins, study of DNA fragmentation (DNA laddering due to the inter-nucleosomal cleavage and DNA comets due to single strand breaks), as well as by FACS analysis of the patterns of cell cycle distribution (pre-G1 phase) and Annexin V/PI staining of the treated Jurkat cells. The induction of apoptosis or necrosis by the particles used to treat Jurkat cells depended on the dose of the particles. Production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) was proposed as a potential mechanism of mag.SLPs-induced cytotoxicity. Accordingly, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical levels in mag.SLPs-treated Jurkat leukemic cells were increased by ~20–40 and ~70%, respectively. In contrast, the non-magnetic SLPs and neat iron oxides did not influence ROS levels significantly. Thus, the developed mag.SLPs can be used for effective killing of human tumor cells, including drug-resistant ones."
Modular Acid-Activatable Acetone-Based Ketal-Linked Nanomedicine by Dexamethasone Prodrugs for Enhanced Anti-Rheumatoid Arthritis with Low Side Effects,"Given the physically encapsulated payloads with drug burst release and/or low drug loading, it is critical to initiate an innovative prodrug strategy to optimize the design of modular nanomedicines. Here, we designed modular pH-sensitive acetone-based ketal-linked prodrugs of dexamethasone (AKP-dexs) and formulated them as nanoparticles. We comprehensively studied the relationships between AKP-dex structure and properties, and we selected two types of AKP-dex-loaded nanoparticles for in vivo studies on the basis of their size, drug loading, and colloidal stability. In a collagen-induced arthritis rat model, these AKP-dex-loaded nanoparticles showed higher accumulation in inflamed joints and better therapeutic efficacy than free dexamethasone phosphate with less-severe side effects. AKP-dex-loaded nanoparticles may be useful for treating other inflammatory diseases and thus have great translational potential. Our findings represent an important step toward the development of practical applications for acetone-based ketal-linked prodrugs and are useful in the design of modular nanomedicines."
Phase dependent encapsulation and release profile of ZIF-based biocomposites,"Biocomposites composed of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIFs) are generating significant interest due to their facile synthesis, and capacity to protect proteins from harsh environments. Here we systematically varied the composition (i.e. relative amounts of ligand (2-methylimidazole), metal precursor (Zn(OAc)2·2H2O), and protein) and post synthetic treatments (i.e. washes with water or water/ethanol) to prepare a series of protein@ZIF biocomposites. These data were used to construct two ternary phase diagrams that showed the synthesis conditions employed gave rise to five different phases including, for the first time, biocomposites based on ZIF-CO3-1. We examined the influence of the different phases on two properties relevant to drug delivery applications: encapsulation efficiency and release profile. The encapsulation efficiencies of bovine serum albumin and insulin were phase dependent and ranged from 75% to 100%. In addition, release profiles showed that 100% protein release varied between 40 and 300 minutes depending on the phase. This study provides a detailed compositional map for the targeted preparation of ZIF-based biocomposites of specific phases and a tool for the straightforward analysis of the crystalline phases of ZIF based materials (web application named ""ZIF phase analysis""). These data will facilitate the progress of ZIF bio-composites in the fields of biomedicine and biotechnology."
"Persicaria hydropiper (L.) Delarbre: A review on traditional uses, bioactive chemical constituents and pharmacological and toxicological activities","Ethnopharmacological relevance: Various plant parts of Persicaria hydropiper (L.) Delarbre (Syn.: Polygonum hydropiper L., Family: Polygonaceae) are used in traditional medicine systems as astringent, sedative, antiseptic and also for the treatment of respiratory disorders, edema and snake bites. It is also used as a spice in many Asian countries. Aim of the review: The main aim of this review is to critically analyze the reported traditional uses, bioactive chemical constituents and pharmacological activities of P. hydropiper. Materials and methods: Scientific database including PubMed, Scopus, SciFinder and secondary resources including books and proceedings were searched using relevant terminologies related to P. hydropiper and available scientific information was critically analyzed. Results: Analysis of the scientific literature regarding the traditional uses revealed that P. hydropiper is used as a medicine and as spice in food preparations in various parts of the world. Various compounds including flavonoids, phenylpropanoid derivatives, and sesquiterpenoids among others were reported as active compounds. The extracts and compounds from P. hydropiper showed diverse biological activities including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cytotoxic, antimicrobial activities, etc. Conclusion: Although various research reports showed diverse biological activities for extracts and compounds obtained from P. hydropiper, very few studies were performed using animal models. Many of these studies also lacked proper experimental setting such as use of positive and negative controls and selection of dose as in most of these studies very high doses of extracts were administered. Further, as P. hydropiper is widely used in the treatment of snake bites and insect bites, such effects of extracts and/or compounds are not well explored. Future studies on P. hydropiper should be focused to establish the links between the traditional uses, active compounds and reported pharmacological activities."
A Methodological Safe-by-Design Approach for the Development of Nanomedicines,"Safe-by-Design (SbD) concepts foresee the risk identification and reduction as well as uncertainties regarding human health and environmental safety in early stages of product development. The EU’s NANoREG project and further on the H2020 ProSafe initiative, NanoReg2, and CALIBRATE projects have developed a general SbD approach for nanotechnologies (e.g., paints, textiles, etc.). Based on it, the GoNanoBioMat project elaborated a methodological SbD approach (GoNanoBioMat SbD approach) for nanomedicines with a focus on polymeric nanobiomaterials (NBMs) used for drug delivery. NBMs have various advantages such as the potential to increase drug efficacy and bioavailability. However, the nanoscale brings new challenges to product design, manufacturing, and handling. Nanomedicines are costly and require the combination of knowledge from several fields. In this paper, we present the GoNanoBioMat SbD approach, which allows identifying and addressing the relevant safety aspects to address when developing polymeric NBMs during design, characterization, assessment of human health and environmental risk, manufacturing and handling, and combines the nanoscale and medicine field under one approach. Furthermore, regulatory requirements are integrated into the innovation process."
Biochemical interactions between LPS and LPS-binding molecules,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, often pose a serious risk not only when delivered in the bloodstream but also in air, the environment and several industrial fields such as pharmaceutics or food. LPS is constituted of three regions; the O-specific chain, the core region and the lipid A, which is the responsible segment of the toxicity. Previous literature dealt with the study of lipid A, its potential ligands as well as the mechanisms of Lipid A interactions that, among other applications, establish the basis for detection methods such as Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assays and emerging biosensoring techniques. However, quantifying LPS binding affinity is an urgent need that still requires thorough studies. In this context, this work reviews the molecules that bind LPS, highlighting quantitative affinity parameters. Moreover, state of the art methods to analyze the affinity and kinetics of lipid-ligand interactions are also reviewed and different techniques have been briefly described. Thus, first, we review existing information on LPS ligands, classifying them into three main groups and targeting the comparison of molecules in terms of their interaction affinities and, second, we establish the basis for further research aimed at the development of effective methods for LPS detection and removal."
Engineering two-dimensional nanomaterials to enable structure-activity relationship studies in nanosafety research,"Emerging, two-dimensional engineered nanomaterials (2DNMs) possess unique and diverse physical and chemical properties, such as extreme aspect ratios, adjustable electronic properties as well as functional lattice defects and surface chemistry which underpin their interactions with biological systems. This perspective highlights the need for structure activity relationship (SAR) studies for key properties of emerging graphene-related and inorganic 2DNMs upon prioritization based on their potential impact and trajectory for large-scale production and applications. Further, it is discussed how a synthesis platform of microbiologically sterile, size-sorted, “model” 2DNMs with precise structure would enable SAR toxicological studies and allow for the sustainable and safe translation of 2D nanotechnology to real-world applications."
Recent advances in the analysis of nanoparticle-protein coronas,"In spite of radical advances in nanobiotechnology, the clinical translation of nanoparticle (NP)-based agents is still a major challenge due to various physiological factors that influence their interactions with biological systems. Recent decade witnessed meticulous investigation on protein corona (PC) that is the first surrounds NPs once administered into the body. Formation of PC around NP surface exhibits resilient effects on their circulation, distribution, therapeutic activity, toxicity and other factors. Although enormous literature is available on the role of PC in altering pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of NPs, understanding on its analytical characterization methods still remains shallow. Therefore, the current review summarizes the impact of PC on biological fate of NPs and stressing on analytical methods employed for studying the NP-PC."
Review of health safety aspects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles in food application,"Food grade titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been widely used as a food additive in the food industry. Compared to TiO2 bulk particles, TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) has even more advantages on application. However, the health safety aspects of the TiO2 NPs via oral exposure have attracted public attention due to its potential toxicity. In this review, the broad application of TiO2 NPs in the field of food industry and estimated human oral exposure as well as the advances in oral toxicity in vivo and in vitro were summarized. Research prospect of food safety of TiO2 NPs was also presented. We hope that this review would provide scientific basis for the safe application of TiO2 NPs and promote the sustainable development of nanotechnology."
Unraveling origins of EPR spectrum in graphene oxide quantum dots,"Carbon nanostructures are utilized in a plethora of applications ranging from biomedicine to electronics. Particularly interesting are carbon nanostructured quantum dots that can be simultaneously used for bimodal therapies with both targeting and imaging capabilities. Here, magnetic and optical properties of graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) prepared by the top-down technique from graphene oxide and obtained using the Hummers’ method were studied. Graphene oxide was ultra-sonicated, boiled in HNO3, ultra-centrifuged, and finally filtrated, reaching a mean flake size of ~30 nm with quantum dot properties. Flake size distributions were obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images after consecutive preparation steps. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) confirmed that GOQDs were still oxidized after the fabrication procedure. Magnetic and photoluminescence measurements performed on the obtained GOQDs revealed their paramagnetic behavior and broad range optical photoluminescence around 500 nm, with magnetic moments of 2.41 µB. Finally, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was used to separate the unforeseen contributions and typically not taken into account metal contaminations, and radicals from carbon defects. This study contributes to a better understanding of magnetic properties of carbon nanostructures, which could in the future be used for the design of multimodal imaging agents."
Trophic transfer and biomagnification of fullerenol nanoparticles in an aquatic food chain,"Understanding the trophic transfer and biomagnification potential of nanomaterials in aquatic food chains is crucial for assessing the environmental risks of such materials. To analyse the fate of fullerenols in an aquatic food chain, we quantitatively investigated the bioaccumulation, tissue-specific distribution, depuration, trophic transfer and biomagnification potential of 13C-labelled fullerenols in a three-level aquatic food chain. The fullerenol nanoparticles accumulated in Scenedesmus obliquus through water exposure, and the latter were ingested by Daphnia magna before being transferred to Danio rerio. The tissues of D. rerio were ranked from highest to lowest fullerenol concentration as follows: intestine > liver > muscle > gills > brain. The biomagnification factor (BMF) value of fullerenols from S. obliquus to D. magna was 3.20, while the calculated fitted BMF from D. magna to D. rerio was less than 1 (BMFf = 0.54). Thus, fullerenols were significantly biomagnified from the first to the second trophic level but not from the second to the third trophic level. Although fullerenols eventually enter fish tissues via the food chain, a lack of biomagnification greatly reduce the potential risk to high-trophic-level aquatic organisms. These results will be useful for environmental and ecological risk assessments of carbon nanomaterials."
Immobilization of mercury by nano-elemental selenium and the underlying mechanisms in hydroponic-cultured garlic plant,"In mining areas, nano-sized elemental selenium (SeNPs), naturally produced through reduction of SeO32- by abiotic and biotic processes, usually co-exists with Hg in the environment. Little is known about the fate of SeNPs and how they affect the bioavailability and toxicity of Hg towards plants. In this study, the fate of SeNPs and Hg, and the effect of SeNPs on the mobilization of Hg in a hydroponic-cultured plant were investigated. It was found that SeNPs were less phytotoxic and had stronger capacity for Hg sequestration than SeO32-and SeO42-. Synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SR-XRF) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy revealed that SeNPs largely captured Hg2+via forming HgSe and HgSeNPs to prevent Hg2+ from entering the root stele, thus inhibiting translocation and accumulation of Hg in the aerial parts. Apart from immobilizing Hg, SeNPs also promoted the conversion of Hg2+ to less toxic RS-Hg-SR and R-Hg-R binding forms in plants. Meanwhile, a portion of SeNPs was transformed into SeMet stored as the nutrient Se source in plant tissues. This study provides insights into the reaction and fate of SeNPs and Hg in water-plant systems, which implies the significance of SeNPs in modulating the fate and toxicity of Hg in mining areas."
"Innovative resources, promotion focus and responsible innovation: The moderating roles of adaptive governance","This paper discusses the relationship between innovative resources, promotion focus, adaptive governance and responsible innovation. In accordance with the path of ""demand-motivation-behavior"", this paper takes adaptive governance as the moderator, and constructs an influence relationship model of ""innovative resources-promotion focus (adaptive governance)-responsible innovation"". Then this paper takes 361 managers from above the middle management level and the technical personnel of enterprises as the investigation objects, and conducts empirical research by using the structural equation model. The results show that: (1) innovative resources have a significant positive impact on responsible innovation; (2) promotion focus partially mediates the effect of innovative resources on responsible innovation; (3) adaptive governance has a positive moderating effect on the relationship between innovative resources and responsible innovation. The results enrich the quantitative research of responsible innovation, reveal the internal mechanism of innovative resources affecting responsible innovation, provide a new way for technological innovation governance and provide a new way of thinking for the transformation from the traditional innovation paradigm into a sustainable innovation paradigm."
A multi-method approach for quantification of surface coatings on commercial zinc oxide nanomaterials,"Surface functionalization is a key factor for determining the performance of nanomaterials in a range of applications and their fate when released to the environment. Nevertheless, it is still relatively rare that surface groups or coatings are quantified using methods that have been carefully optimized and validated with a multi-method approach. We have quantified the surface groups on a set of commercial ZnO nanoparticles modified with three different reagents ((3-aminopropyl)-triethoxysilane, caprylsilane and stearic acid). This study used thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of evolved gases and quantitative solution1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for quantification purposes with13C-solid state NMR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to confirm assignments. Unmodified materials from the same suppliers were examined to assess possible impurities and corrections. The results demonstrate that there are significant mass losses from the unmodified samples which are attributed to surface carbonates or residual materials from the synthetic procedure used. The surface modified materials show a characteristic loss of functional group between 300–600◦C as confirmed by analysis of FT-IR spectra and comparison to NMR data obtained after quantitative release/extraction of the functional group from the surface. The agreement between NMR and TGA estimates for surface loading is reasonably good for cases where the functional group accounts for a relatively large fraction of the sample mass (e.g., large groups or high loading). In other cases TGA does not have sufficient sensitivity for quantitative analysis, particularly when contaminants contribute to the TGA mass loss. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and solid state NMR for selected samples provide support for the assignment of both the functional groups and some impurities. The level of surface group loading varies significantly with supplier and even for different batches or sizes of nanoparticles from the same supplier. These results highlight the importance of developing reliable methods to detect and quantify surface functional groups and the importance of a multi-method approach."
Metal-hygroscopic polymer conductors that can secrete solders for connections in stretchable devices,"Wearable electronics have great potential to enable seamless human-machine interfaces and can dramatically improve the quality of life by using advanced monitoring and therapeutic devices. Despite great progress in wearable devices, very few wearable devices can be both highly integrable and stretchable (strain >100%) due to the lack of reliable connections between the soft conductors and rigid electronics. Here, we report highly stretchable metal-hygroscopic polymer conductors that can secrete solders for connections. Propelled by changing humidity, liquid metal particles within conductors will merge and erupt, providing electrical connections for electronics, while the coated adhesive can provide mechanical connections. Thus, rigid electronics can be stably connected on conductors by pressure, with no extra solder, solvent or heat being required. The stable connections and high stretchability of the conductors (105 S m-1 at a strain of 800%) allow integrated electronics to stretch to a strain of 150%. We have created a stretchable, integrated device that is double-sided and multi-layered and it can sense the oxygen saturation in blood, heart rate, strain and temperature."
Intrinsic Biotaxi Solution Based on Blood Cell Membrane Cloaking Enables Fullerenol Thrombolysis in Vivo,"We report the construction of blood cell membrane cloaked mesoporous silica nanoparticles for delivery of nanoparticles [fullerenols (Fols)] with fibrinolysis activity which endows the active Fol with successful thrombolysis effect in vivo. In vitro, Fols present excellent fibrinolysis activity, and the Fol with the best fibrinolysis activity is screened based on the correlation between Fols' structure and their fibrinolysis activity. However, the thrombolytic effect in vivo is not satisfactory. To rectify the unsatisfactory situation and avoid the exogenous stimuli, a natural blood cell membrane cloaking strategy with loading the active Fol is chosen to explore as a novel thrombolysis drug. After cloaking, the therapeutic platform prolongs blood circulation time and enhances the targeting effect. Interestingly, compared with platelet membrane cloaking, red blood cell (RBC) membrane cloaking demonstrates stronger affinity with fibrin and more enrichment at the thrombus site. The Fol with RBC cloaking shows quick and efficient thrombolysis efficacy in vivo with less bleeding risk, more excellent blood compatibility, and better biosafety when compared with the clinical drug urokinase (UK). These findings not only validate the blood cell membrane cloaking strategy as an effective platform for Fol delivery on thrombolysis treatment, but also hold a great promising solution for other active nanoparticle deliveries in vivo."
The current understanding of autophagy in nanomaterial toxicity and its implementation in safety assessment-related alternative testing strategies,"Nanotechnology has rapidly promoted the development of a new generation of industrial and commercial products; however, it has also raised some concerns about human health and safety. To evaluate the toxicity of the great diversity of nanomaterials (NMs) in the traditional manner, a tremendous number of safety assessments and a very large number of animals would be required. For this reason, it is necessary to consider the use of alternative testing strategies or methods that reduce, refine, or replace (3Rs) the use of animals for assessing the toxicity of NMs. Autophagy is considered an early indicator of NM interactions with cells and has been recently recognized as an important form of cell death in nanoparticle-induced toxicity. Impairment of autophagy is related to the accelerated pathogenesis of diseases. By using mechanism-based high-throughput screening in vitro, we can predict the NMs that may lead to the generation of disease outcomes in vivo. Thus, a tiered testing strategy is suggested that includes a set of standardized assays in relevant human cell lines followed by critical validation studies carried out in animals or whole organism models such as C. elegans (Caenorhabditis elegans), zebrafish (Danio rerio), and Drosophila (Drosophila melanogaster)for improved screening of NM safety. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms by which NMs perturb biological systems, including autophagy induction, is critical for a more comprehensive elucidation of nanotoxicity. A more profound understanding of toxicity mechanisms will also facilitate the development of prevention and intervention policies against adverse outcomes induced by NMs. The development of a tiered testing strategy for NM hazard assessment not only promotes a more widespread adoption of non-rodent or 3R principles but also makes nanotoxicology testing more ethical, relevant, and cost-and time-efficient."
Clinically Approved Carbon Nanoparticles with Oral Administration for Intestinal Radioprotection via Protecting the Small Intestinal Crypt Stem Cells and Maintaining the Balance of Intestinal Flora,"The exploration of an old drug for new biomedical applications has an absolute predominance in shortening the clinical conversion time of drugs for clinical application. In this work, carbon nanoparticles suspension injection (CNSI), the first clinically approved carbon nanoparticles in China, is explored as a new nano-radioprotective agent for potent intestinal radioprotection. CNSI shows powerful radioprotective performance in the intestine under oral administration, including efficient free radical scavenging ability, good biosafety, high chemical stability, and relatively long retention time. For example, CNSI shows high reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activities, which effectively alleviates the mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA double-strand breaks to protect the cells against radiation-induced damage. Most importantly, this efficient ROS scavenging ability greatly helps restrain the apoptosis of the small intestinal epithelial and crypt stem cells, which decreases the damage of the mechanical barrier and thus relieves radiation enteritis. Moreover, CNSI helps remove the free radicals in the intestinal microenvironment and thus maintain the balance of intestinal flora so as to mitigate the radiation enteritis. The finding suggests a new application of clinically approved carbon nanoparticles, which not only promotes the development of new intestinal radioprotector, but also has a great potential for clinical transformation."
Tuning liposome composition to modulate corona formation in human serum and cellular uptake,"Nano-sized objects such as liposomes are modified by adsorption of biomolecules in biological fluids. The resulting corona critically changes nanoparticle behavior at cellular level. A better control of corona composition could allow to modulate uptake by cells. Within this context, in this work, liposomes of different charge were prepared by mixing negatively charged and zwitterionic lipids to different ratios. The series obtained was used as a model system with tailored surface properties to modulate corona composition and determine the effects on liposome interactions with cells. Uptake efficiency and uptake kinetics of the different liposomes were determined by flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging. Particular care was taken in optimizing the methods to isolate the corona forming in human serum to prevent liposome agglomeration and to exclude residual free proteins, which could confuse the results. Thanks to the optimized methods, mass spectrometry of replicate corona isolations showed excellent reproducibility and this allowed semi-quantitative analysis to determine for each formulation the most abundant proteins in the corona. The results showed that by changing the fraction of zwitterionic and charged lipids in the bilayer, the amount and identity of the most abundant proteins adsorbed from serum differed. Interestingly, the formulations also showed very different uptake kinetics. Similar approaches can be used to tune lipid composition in a systematic way in order to obtain formulations with the desired corona and cell uptake behavior. Statement of significance: Liposomes and other nano-sized objects when introduced in biological fluids are known to adsorb biomolecules forming the so-called nanoparticle corona. This layer strongly affects the subsequent interactions of liposomes with cells. Here, by tuning lipid composition in a systematic way, a series of liposomes with tailored surface properties has been prepared to modulate the corona forming in human serum. Liposomes with very different cellular uptake kinetics have been obtained and their corona was identified in order to determine the most enriched proteins on the different formulations. By combining corona composition and uptake kinetics candidate corona proteins associated with reduced or increased uptake by cells can be identified and the liposome formulation can be tuned to obtain the desired uptake behavior."
Carbon nanotube–mediated antibody-free suspension array for determination of typical endocrine-disrupting chemicals,"A carbon nanotube (CNT)–mediated antibody-free suspension array (CASA) by integration of functionalized CNTs and aptamer (Apt) into xMAP® technology for simultaneous determination of typical endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) was developed . The interaction between CNTs and Apt acts as an effective and straightforward signal recognition, transformation, and amplification strategy. The amino-functionalized CNTs are covalently modified on the carboxyl-functionalized magnetic bead (MB) and further physically bridging with biotinylated Apt. CNTs on the surface of MBs not only increase the amount of Apt for target binding and signal amplification but also maintain the biological activity of Apt. After magnetic separation, the encoded MB address was distinguished and the concentration of the target in the liquid was negatively correlated with median fluorescence intensity. A series of environmental water samples were analysed by CASA, traditional immuno-SA, and competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for validation. The results obtained using CASA well matched for the multiplexed detection of various targets with dynamic concentration range from 6.40 × 10−5 to 4.00 μg L−1 within 1 h. The method also confirmed good selectively, accuracy, and consistency with high-performance liquid chromatography. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]"
Key challenges for evaluation of the safety of engineered nanomaterials,"The development of reliable and practical tools to ensure the safe and sustainable use of nanomaterials has not kept pace with the rapid commercialization of nanotechnology-enabled products. Here we present an overview of some of the current challenges and opportunities for the evaluation of the safety of engineered nanomaterials (ENM), based on input from an IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) sponsored workshop in Queretaro, Mexico. The workshop covered detection and characterization of ENM, their transformations in consumer products and the environment, current gaps in nanotoxicology methods and challenges for standardization and risk assessment. Key future research priorities include developing methods to detect and characterize ENM in complex matrices and determinations of their transformations in such environments. The extension of methods to more challenging materials such as complex or advanced nanomaterials and carbon-based materials is also needed. Furthermore, an increased availability of validated protocols and reference materials will be necessary to advance both nanosafety studies and material characterization. A focus on accurate dosimetry, appropriate control experiments and more realistic in vitro models will help to address current gaps in nanotoxicology. Finally, there is an urgent need for reliable data and improved data reporting guidelines, supported by computational modeling, in order to allow the development of grouping and read across methods."
Facilely synthesized recyclable mesoporous magnetic silica composite for highly efficient and fast adsorption of Methylene Blue from wastewater: Thermodynamic mechanism and kinetics study,"This work prepared a highly efficient and recyclable mesoporous adsorbent for fast removing Methylene Blue (MB) from wastewater, and investigated the related adsorption mechanism. With a facile chemical surface-deposition method, a new kind of mesoporous magnetic silica composite (MMSC) was successfully prepared and performed well in removing MB from simulated textile wastewater. Multi-methods were used to characterize the prepared MMSC, and showed that the obtained material had a high specific surface area (309.10 m2/g). The results verified that there was a synergistic effect on removing MB after Fe3O4 depositing on the surface of SiO2. The adsorption mechanism of MB on MMSC was revealed by the adsorption kinetic and thermodynamic experiments, which indicated that the kinetics could be well described by the pseudo second-order model, and the equilibrium be explained by the Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum capacity of MB on the prepared MMSC was 115.20 mg/g under the optimal conditions."
p53 controls the switch between autophagy and apoptosis through regulation of PLSCR1 in sodium selenite-treated leukemia cells,"Coordinated regulation of autophagy and apoptosis helps to enhance the antitumor effects of sodium selenite. However, the potential molecules that act as switch nodes in the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis is still elusive. Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) has been shown to regulate leukocyte differentiation, while its role in autophagy/apoptosis toggle switch remains unexplored. In this study, we showed that sodium selenite switched protective autophagy to apoptosis in p53-wild type NB4 cells without obvious caspase-8/apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) axis activation, while induced autophagy-dependent caspase-8/AIF axis activation in p53-mutant Jurkat cells. Additionally, p53 was demonstrated as a positive regulator of PLSCR1. p53-dependent up-regulation of PLSCR1 accounted for the differential regulation of autophagy and apoptosis induced by sodium selenite. Furthermore, sodium selenite induced the release of AIF from mitochondria to cytosol with the facilitation of caspase-8 in Jurkat cells, while not in NB4 cells. The released AIF further enhanced autophagy flux through interacting with PLSCR1, which hereby resulting in the disassociation of PLSCR1 from Atg5-Atg12 complex. Our results indicate that PLSCR1 plays a critical role in p53-dependent regulation of autophagy and apoptosis in sodium selenite-treated leukemia cells. Manipulation of p53-PLSCR1 cascade might be beneficial to enhance the anti-tumor effects of sodium selenite."
Generative Critique in Interdisciplinary Collaborations: From Critique in and of the Neurosciences to Socio-Technical Integration Research as a Practice of Critique in R(R)I,"Discourses on Responsible Innovation and Responsible Research and Innovation, in short R(R)I, have revolved around but not elaborated on the notion of critique. In this article, generative critique is introduced to R(R)I as a practice that sits in-between adversarial armchair critique and co-opted, uncritical service. How to position oneself and be positioned on this spectrum has puzzled humanities scholars and social scientists who engage in interdisciplinary collaborations with scientists, engineers, and other professionals. Recently, generative critique has been presented as a solution to the puzzle in interdisciplinary collaborations on neuroscientific experiments. Generative critique seeks to create connections across disciplines that help remake seemingly stable objects in moments when taken-for-granted ways of seeing and approaching objects are unsettled. In order to translate generative critique from the neurosciences to R(R)I, socio-technical integration research (STIR) is proposed as a practice of generative critique in interdisciplinary R(R)I collaborations. These collaborations aim to account for societal aspects in research and technology development. For this purpose, a variety of approaches have been developed, including STIR and video-reflexive ethnography (VRE). STIR and VRE resemble each other but diverge on affective, collaborative, and temporal dimensions. Their juxtaposition serves to develop suggestions for how STIR could be modified on these dimensions to better enact generative critique in interdisciplinary R(R)I collaborations. In this way, the article contributes to ongoing discussions in R(R)I and in the engaged programme in science and technology studies more broadly on the dynamics of positioning in collaborative work."
International landscape of limits and recommendations for occupational exposure to engineered nanomaterials,"The increasing concern of possible adverse effects on human health derived from occupational engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) exposure is an issue addressed by entities related to provide guidelines and/or protocols for ENMs regulation. Here we analysed 17 entities from America, Europe and Asia, and some of these entities provide limits of exposure extrapolated from the non-nanosized counterparts of ENMs. The international landscape shows that recommendations are mostly made for metal oxide based ENMs and tonnage is one of the main criteria for ENMs registration, however, sub-nanometric ENMs are emerging and perhaps a novel category of ENMs will appear soon. We identify that besides the lack of epidemiological evidence of ENMs toxicity in humans and difficulties in analysing the toxicological data derived from experimental models, the lack of information on airborne concentrations of ENMs in occupational settings is an important limitation to improve the experimental designs. The development of regulations related to ENMs exposure would lead to provide safer work places for ENMs production without delaying the nanotechnology progress but will also help to protect the environment by taking opportune and correct measures for nanowaste, considering that this could be a great environmental problem in the coming future."
Sanding and analysis of dust from nano-silica filled composite resins for stereolithography,"The aim of this work was to assess whether with high amounts of nano-silica filled cured resins release nano-particles upon their abrasion, as this could form an occupational health risk and require specific safety measures. A standardised abrasion stress method involving a Taber linear abrasion apparatus (Model 5750) has been applied to the filled polymer samples. This linear abrasion apparatus simulates the mechanical solicitation, i.e. abrasion. Various particle size measurement techniques were applied to assess the size distribution and the quantity of particles released. Observations of airborne particle from abrasion tests are consistent with TEM characterization of the nanomaterials before any tests. Abrasions of both samples (called here ‘1’ and ‘2’) gave rise to emissions. For sample 1, a few ‘dust’ particles and micronic particles are observed. For sample 2, despite a track on the sample, no detectable micronic particles and very few ‘dust’, particles are detected. As a result, we can state there were effective abrasions which gave rise to a low emission (sample 1) and a very low emission (sample 2) under the detection limits of particle sizing and counting, for the last case. The emission of particles upon Taber test abrasion is extremely low (less than 8 particles per cm3) and for one of the samples at the level of the detection limit. Moreover, the size of these particles is generally larger than 100 nm."
Nanomaterials to avoid and destroy protein aggregates,"Aggregation of proteins is involved in many disorders. Besides amyloid fibrils, which mostly form in the brain, other kind of protein aggregates can lead, for example, to clots in the blood or floaters in the vitreous of the eye. This review aims to overview on how nanomaterials could be employed to avoid and destroy most diverse protein aggregates. Indeed, thanks to their recognized versatility, (stimuli-responsive) nanomaterials may offer attractive features against harmful protein aggregates. However, despite the many conceptually interesting strategies it appears that most important information on both the in vivo efficacy and safety of nanotechnology based prevention or destruction of protein aggregates, which is highly needed to pave the way to clinically relevant therapies, remains missing."
Importance of measuring pharmacologically active metabolites of edoxaban: development and validation of an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a tandem mass spectrometry method,"Although DOACs do not require regular measurements of their blood concentrations, clinical situations may require an assessment of their concentration. Among the factor Xa inhibitors, edoxaban is the only compound for which some metabolites (e.g. edoxaban-M4) are reported to be pharmacologically active. Therefore, their contribution could interfere with assays used for the estimation of edoxaban concentration. In addition, drug interactions may alter the metabolite/parent compound ratio making the sole estimation of edoxaban concentration, a poor assessment of the overall anticoagulation. To develop a validated UHPLC–MS/MS method to quantify simultaneously edoxaban and its more relevant M4-metabolite in human plasma. Electrospray ionization and chromatographic separation were optimized for the simultaneous dosage of edoxaban and edoxaban-M4. The method was validated according to regulatory guidelines for bioanalytical method validation. The total run time was 6 min. The method was validated for calibration curves, precision, accuracy, carry-over, selectivity, matrix effect and short-time stability. This method permits quantification of edoxaban and edoxaban-M4 providing complementary information about the inhibitory effect of this active metabolite in chronometric or chromogenic assays. Although patients treated with edoxaban exhibits usually low concentrations of active metabolites, the measurement of edoxaban-M4 is interesting; especially in case of drug interactions. Indeed, concomitant prescriptions of edoxaban and carbamazepine or rifampicin is frequent and may lead to disturbance of the estimations of edoxaban concentration by chromogenic anti-Xa assays. Therefore, patients are at risk of having inadequate control of anticoagulation supporting the need of measuring the most representative edoxaban metabolite concomitantly to the parent compound."
Self-assembly of DNA Nanostructures via Bioinspired Metal Ion Coordination,"Despite a growing interest in DNA nanomaterials, their simple synthesis remains a challenge. A simple and general strategy for constructing DNA-based nanomaterials by metal ion coordination is reported. The metal-DNA nanoparticles(NPs) could be synthesized with DNA molecules of diverse sequence and various metal ions of intrinsic property, resulting in multifunctional NPs with the combined advantages of both inorganic and DNA building blocks. It is demonstrated that the hybrid metal-DNA NPs could be engineered for magnetic resonance and luminescence imaging, encapsulation of multifarious nucleic acids with controlled ratio, and co-assembly with small drug molecules. Furthermore, because these metal-DNA NPs exhibited enhanced cellular uptake compared to free synthetic DNA, they hold potential for applications in diagnostics and therapeutics."
Particle emission of organic brake pad material: A review,"Wear of a brake pad emits airborne particles and is a major environmental issue. This review paper deals with the analysis of different brake pad composite materials and their wear phenomenon. The volume fraction and size distribution of non-asbestos organic airborne particles emitted from the brake pad material with time, load and speed have also been discussed under different braking conditions. The airborne particles are measured by different aerosol instruments. TSI P-Trak, GRIMM aerosol spectrometer and scanning mobility particle sizer were used by different researchers for measuring ultrafine particles, micron-sized particles and aerodynamic nanoparticles, respectively. This paper shows that the wear particles emitted from the brake pad material vary in diameter between 10 nm and 10 μm under various loads and sliding velocities. These airborne particles such as coarse fine (diameters > 1 μm), fine (diameters between 100 nm and 1 μm) and ultrafine (diameters < 100 nm) particles are responsible for health hazards to the human respiratory system. This study has accumulated the data of different ingredients of the brake pad with airborne particle emission from various studies, which may be helpful for the evolution of new composite materials in the near future."
Microfluidics for Biomedical Analysis,"Many new techniques and materials have been applied to microfluidic systems in the past decade, and integrated microfluidic chips have become powerful platforms for realizing highly sensitive, high throughput, and low-cost analysis. This article reviews the latest advancements of microfluidic platforms for biological and biomedical analysis in the fields of fundamental biology research, clinical application, food safety, and environmental monitoring, with a focus on nucleic acid-based molecular diagnosis and protein-based immunodiagnosis. The combination of microfluidics with advanced techniques (e.g., nanotechnology, 3D printing, deep learning) would offer innovative new tools for bioanalyses. The current challenges and the future developments of microfluidic technologies for clinical applications are also discussed. It is anticipated that this review will be beneficial to promoting microfluidics toward a broad range of applications in the future."
Summertime and wintertime atmospheric processes of secondary aerosol in Beijing,"<p>Secondary aerosol constitutes a large fraction of fine particles in urban air of China. However, its formation mechanisms and atmospheric processes remain largely uncertain despite considerable study in recent years. To elucidate the seasonal variations in fine-particle composition and secondary aerosol formation, an Aerodyne quadrupole aerosol chemical speciation monitor (Q-ACSM), combined with other online instruments, was used to characterize the sub-micrometer particulate matter (diameter&thinsp;<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">&lt;</span>&thinsp;1&thinsp;<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">μ</span>m, <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">PM1</span>) in Beijing during summer and winter 2015. Our results suggest that photochemical oxidation was the major pathway for sulfate formation during summer, whereas aqueous-phase reaction became an important process for sulfate formation during winter. High concentrations of nitrate (17&thinsp;% of the <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">PM1</span> mass) were found during winter, explained by enhanced gas-To-particle partitioning at low temperature, while high nitrate concentrations (19&thinsp;%) were also observed under the conditions of high relative humidity (RH) during summer, likely due to the hydrophilic property of <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">NH4NO3</span> and hydrolysis of <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">N2O5</span>. As for organic aerosol (OA) sources, secondary OA (SOA) dominated the OA mass (74&thinsp;%) during summer, while the SOA contribution decreased to 39&thinsp;% during winter due to enhanced primary emissions in the heating season. In terms of the SOA formation, photochemical oxidation perhaps played an important role for summertime oxygenated OA (OOA) formation and less-oxidized wintertime OOA (LO-OOA) formation. The wintertime more-oxidized OOA (MO-OOA) showed a good correlation with aerosol liquid water content (ALWC), indicating a more important contribution of aqueous-phase processing over photochemical production to MO-OOA. Meanwhile, the dependence of LO-OOA and the mass ratio of LO-OOA to MO-OOA on atmospheric oxidative tracer (i.e., <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O<i>x</i></span>) both degraded when RH<span idCombining double low line""page3794""/> was greater than 60&thinsp;%, suggesting that RH or aerosol liquid water may also affect LO-OOA formation."
Novel polyethylene oxide coatings implementing ultra-stable laser-ablated silver nanoparticles,Nanocomposites based on polyethylene oxide and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were developed as new active antimicrobial and antibiofilm coatings. Silver colloids were synthesized by nanosecond-pulsed laser ablation synthesis in solution using an organic solvent to ensure a long-term stability of nanocolloids and a good solubility in polymeric solution. AgNPs were incorporated in a biodegradable polymer matrix for the preparation of composite films. The coatings’ surface chemical composition (assessed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) was correlated with the ion release.
Quantitative Particle Uptake by Cells as Analyzed by Different Methods,"There is a large number of two-dimensional static in vitro studies about the uptake of colloidal nano- and microparticles, which has been published in the last decade. In this Minireview, different methods used for such studies are summarized and critically discussed. Supplementary experimental data allow for a direct comparison of the different techniques. Emphasis is given on how quantitative parameters can be extracted from studies in which different experimental techniques have been used, with the goal of allowing better comparison."
Combating Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms by a Chitosan-PEG-Peptide Conjugate via Changes in Assembled Structure,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) biofilms are associated with a wide range of infections, from chronic tissue diseases to implanted medical devices. In a biofilm, the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) causes an inhibited penetration of antibacterial agents, leading to a 100-1000 times tolerance of the bacteria. In view of the water-filled channels in biofilms and the highly negative charge of EPS, we design a chitosan-polyethylene glycol-peptide conjugate (CS-PEG-LK13) in this study. The CS-PEG-LK13 prefers a neutrally charged assembly at a size of ∼100 nm in aqueous environment, while undergoes disassembly to expose the α-helical peptide at the bacterial cell membrane. This behavior provides CS-PEG-LK13 superiorities in both penetrating the biofilms and inactivating the bacteria. At a concentration of 8 times the minimum inhibitory concentration, CS-PEG-LK13 has a much higher antibacterial efficiency (72.70%) than LK13 peptide (15.24%) and tobramycin (33.57%) in an in vitro P. aeruginosa biofilm. Moreover, CS-PEG-LK13 behaves comparable capability of combating an implanted P. aeruginosa biofilm to highly excess tobramycin. This work has implications for the design of new antibacterial agents in biofilm combating."
Tuning the Morphological Appearance of Iron(III) Fumarate: Impact on Material Characteristics and Biocompatibility,"Iron(III) fumarate materials are well suited for biomedical applications as they feature biocompatible building blocks, porosity, chemical functionalizability, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity. The synthesis of these materials however is difficult to control, and it has been challenging to produce monodisperse particle sizes and morphologies that are required in medical use. Here, we report the optimization of iron(III) fumarate nano- A nd microparticle synthesis by surfactant-free methods, including room temperature, solvothermal, microwave, and microfluidic conditions. Four variants of iron(III) fumarate with distinct morphologies were isolated and are characterized in detail. Structural characterization shows that all iron(III) fumarate variants exhibit the metal-organic framework (MOF) structure of MIL-88A. Nanoparticles with a diameter of 50 nm were produced, which contain crystalline areas not exceeding 5 nm. Solvent-dependent swelling of the crystalline particles was monitored using in situ X-ray diffraction. Cytotoxicity experiments showed that all iron(III) fumarate variants feature adequate biotolerability and no distinct interference with cellular metabolism at low concentrations. Magnetic resonance relaxivity studies using clinical MRI equipment, on the other hand, proved that the MRI contrast characteristics depend on particle size and morphology. All in all, this study demonstrates the possibility of tuning the morphological appearance of iron(III) fumarate particles and illustrates the importance of optimizing synthesis conditions for the development of new biomedical materials."
Cell-Penetrating Nanoparticles Activate the Inflammasome to Enhance Antibody Production by Targeting Microtubule-Associated Protein 1-Light Chain 3 for Degradation,"Engineered nanoparticles could trigger inflammatory responses and potentiate a desired innate immune response for efficient immunotherapy. Here we report size-dependent activation of innate immune signaling pathways by gold (Au) nanoparticles. The ultrasmall-size (<10 nm) Au nanoparticles preferentially activate the NLRP3 inflammasome for Caspase-1 maturation and interleukin-1β production, while the larger-size Au nanoparticles (>10 nm) trigger the NF-κB signaling pathway. Ultrasmall (4.5 nm) Au nanoparticles (Au4.5) activate the NLRP3 inflammasome through directly penetrating into cell cytoplasm to promote robust ROS production and target autophagy protein-LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1-light chain 3) for proteasomal degradation in an endocytic/phagocytic-independent manner. LC3-dependent autophagy is required for inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation and plays a critical role in the negative control of inflammasome activation. Au4.5 nanoparticles promote the degradation of LC3, thus relieving the LC3-mediated inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Finally, we show that Au4.5 nanoparticles could function as vaccine adjuvants to markedly enhance ovalbumin (OVA)-specific antibody production in an NLRP3-dependent pattern. Our findings have provided molecular insights into size-dependent innate immune signaling activation by cell-penetrating nanoparticles and identified LC3 as a potential regulatory target for efficient immunotherapy."
N-Doping Holey Graphene TiO<inf>2</inf>-Pt Composite as Efficient Electrocatalyst for Methanol Oxidation,"The nitrogen-doped holey graphene oxide/TiO2 (TiO2-NHGO) composite is synthesized as catalyst support for the Pt catalyst. The resulting catalyst, Pt-TiO2-rNHGO, shows higher activity and stability for methanol electrooxidation than the Pt-rGO, Pt-rHGO, and Pt-rNHGO catalysts. The enhancement is because of the combinatory effect of nanoholes in the graphene plane which provide more active sites and efficient mass transport, well-distributed N-doping, and the uniform distribution of TiO2 NPs on NHGO nanosheets which facilitate to form more uniformly dispersed Pt NPs. In addition, the strong interactions among Pt, TiO2, and NHGO also contribute to enhance the performance of catalyst for methanol oxidation."
Initiation of protective autophagy in hepatocytes by gold nanorod core/silver shell nanostructures,"The high reactivity of silver nanoparticles leads to their broad applications in the anti-bacterial field; however, the safety of silver nanoparticles has attracted increasing public attention. After exposure to silver nanoparticles in vivo, the liver serves as their potential deposition site; however the potential biological effects of such nanoparticles on hepatocytes at low dosages are not well understood. Here, we study the interaction between gold nanorod core/silver shell nanostructures (Au@Ag NRs) and human hepatocytes, HepG2 cells, and determine that Au@Ag NRs at sub-lethal doses can induce autophagy. After uptake, Au@Ag NRs mainly localize in the lysosomes where they release silver ions and promote the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS then suppress the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway and activate autophagy. In addition, oxidative stress results in lysosomal impairment, causing decreased ability for lysosomal digestion. Moreover, oxidative stress also affects the structure and function of mitochondria, leading to the initiation of protective autophagy to eliminate the damaged mitochondrion. Our study shows that at sub-lethal dosages, silver nanomaterials may alter the physiological functions of hepatic cells by activating protective autophagy and cause potential health risks, indicating that cautious consideration of the safety of nanomaterials for certain applications is necessary."
"Graphene Oxide-Induced pH Alteration, Iron Overload, and Subsequent Oxidative Damage in Rice (Oryza sativa L.): A New Mechanism of Nanomaterial Phytotoxicity","The mechanism of graphene-based nanomaterial (GBM)-induced phytotoxicity and its association with the GBM physicochemical properties are not yet fully understood. The present study compared the effects of graphene oxide (GO) and reduced GO (rGO) on rice seedling growth under hydroponic conditions for 3 weeks. GO at 100 and 250 mg/L reduced shoot biomass (by 25 and 34%, respectively) and shoot elongation (by 17 and 43%, respectively) and caused oxidative damage, while rGO exhibited no overt effect except for the enhancement of the antioxidant enzyme activities, suggesting that the surface oxygen content is a critical factor affecting the biological impacts of GBMs. GO treatments (100 and 250 mg/L) enhanced the iron (Fe) translocation and caused excessive Fe accumulation in shoots (2.2 and 3.6 times higher than control), which was found to be the main reason for the oxidative damage in shoots. GO-induced acidification of the nutrient solution was the main driver for the Fe overload in plants. In addition to the antioxidant regulators, the plants triggered other pathways to defend against the Fe toxicity via downregulation of the Fe transport associated metabolites (mainly coumarins and flavonoids). Plant root exudates facilitated the reduction of toxic GO to nontoxic rGO, acting as another route for plant adaption to GO-induced phytotoxicity. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of the phytotoxicity of GBMs. It also provides implications for the agricultural application of GBM that the impacts of GBMs on the uptake of multiple nutrients in plants should be assessed simultaneously and reduced forms of GBMs are preferential to avoid toxicity."
BiO<inf>2-x</inf> Nanosheets as Radiosensitizers with Catalase-Like Activity for Hypoxia Alleviation and Enhancement of the Radiotherapy of Tumors,"Tumor hypoxia is known to be one of the vital factors that aggravate tumor resistance to radiation therapy (RT) in which oxygen plays a critical role in tumor destruction. Herein, we synthesize a simple nanoradiosensitizer based on ultrathin BiO2-x nanosheets (NSs) modified with Tween 20 (T-BiO2-x NSs) to overcome the hypoxia-induced radioresistance as well as increase the efficacy of RT. On the one hand, bismuth as a high-Z element can effectively enhance the sensitivity of RT by depositing a higher radiation dose in tumors. The semiconductor property also endows its photocatalytic ability to produce extra reactive oxygen species (ROS) by reaction with the surrounding water. On the other hand, the defect-abundant BiO2-x NSs are also found to decompose the highly expressed hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at the tumor site into oxygen (O2) for combating hypoxia. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that the as-prepared T-BiO2-x NSs could effectively inhibit tumor growth with X-ray irradiation. Our work thus provides a simple nanoradiosensitizer with multifunctionalities for increasing the RT efficacy while alleviating tumor hypoxia at the same time."
Aerosol aggregation through modulated symmetrically opposing acoustic field in normal 16-sided waveguide coupled with resonators,"Aerosol control is a big revolution in production and use of submicronic particles. Developing a novel aerosol control technology in the area is the study objective of this paper. Attributing to the aerosol control potential in acoustics, a normal 16-sided aerosol aggregation chamber (pelletier dish) symmetrically installed with 16 poles of Helmholtz sound source (HSS) is successfully used to aggregate smog aerosols. The aerosols are generated by the combustion of chemical material. In the acoustic conditions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 beams of opposing waves, the shapes of aerosol distribution always display as the specific aerosol petals of number equaling to the operating number of HSS. With the increase of the operating number, the removal effectiveness rises gradually to 1.5 wavelengths, obviously larger than half wavelengths achieved in the previous study. The results are repeatability in experiment, and especially the aerosol aggregation can be pre-designed by acoustic field simulation."
"Bioaccumulation, biodistribution，and depuration of <sup>13</sup>C-labelled fullerenols in zebrafish through dietary exposure","In aquatic organisms, dietary exposure to nanomaterials is not only one of the important uptake pathways, but it is also one method to assess the transmission risk of the food chain. To address this concern, we quantitatively investigated the accumulation and depuration of fullerenols in the tissues of zebrafish after exposure to fullerenols-contaminated Daphnia magna. After exposure to 13C-labelled fullerenol solution at a concentration of 2.5 mg/L for 72 h, the steady state concentration of fullerenols in D. magna was 31.20 ± 1.59 mg/g dry weight. During the 28 d uptake period for zebrafish, fullerenols in the tissues increased in a tissue- and day-dependent manner, and the major target tissues of fullerenols were the intestines and liver, followed by the gill, muscle, and brain. The kinetic parameters of uptake and depuration were also quantitatively analyzed. After depuration for 15 d, a certain amount of residual fullerenols remained in the tissues, especially the brain, where approximately 64 d may be needed to achieve 90% of the cumulative concentration depuration. The calculated distribution-based trophic transfer factors (TTFd values) (from 0.26 to 0.49) indicated that the tissue biomagnification of fullerenols by zebrafish through dietary exposure may not occur. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the presence of fullerenols in D. magna and the tissues of zebrafish. Our research data are essential for thoroughly understanding of the fate of nanoparticles through the dietary exposure pathway and directing future tissue bioeffect studies regarding target tissues for further research. Fullerenols could be transferred from D. magna to zebrafish and further enter into tissues. The depuration rates of fullerenols in different tissues were found to be in the following order: gill > intestine > liver > muscle > brain."
What happens to silver-based nanoparticles if they meet seawater?,"Silver based nanoparticles (Ag-b-NPs) in the environment are of current concern as they may pose risks to human and environmental health, even at low concentration levels. It is widely known that Ag-b-NPs, once released from products containing these particles for antimicrobial reasons, can pass through wastewater treatment plants to some extent. These particles are transported via running waterways and eventually reach the sea. However, the fate of environmentally relevant ng L−1 traces of Ag-b-NPs in seawater has not yet been sufficiently studied. Analytical techniques capable of determining these ultratraces of Ag-b-NPs in seawater are scarce and struggle furthermore with the high chloride content in highly saline matrices, such as seawater. In this study, we extracted Ag-b-NPs from matrices with varying salinity via cloud point extraction (CPE) and determined concentration and size of Ag-b-NPs in extracts with single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (sp-ICP-MS). Applying this extraction and measurement technique, we were able to investigate the fate of Ag-b-NPs with different coatings (citrate and the predominant coatings in nature, silver sulfide and silver chloride) in matrices with increasing salinity and real seawater. All types of Ag-b-NPs were dissolved in all matrices almost independently of the chemical composition of the nanoparticles (NPs), whereas dissolution rates increased with increasing salinity due to the formation of soluble Ag(I) species and - in the presence of chloride - AgClx1-x (x > 1) complexes. After an incubation time of not more than 72 h, Ag-b-NPs were dissolved almost completely. During the dissolution process, NP shrinkage could be clearly observed by sp-ICP-MS. Supplementary electron microscopy measurements revealed that the sulfur content in silver sulfide nanoparticles (Ag2S-NPs) increased during the dissolution process. Finally, we were able to investigate the dissolution process of real Ag-b-NPs in wastewater after increasing the salinity to seawater levels."
One step approach for hybrid photocatalyst synthesis: Synergetic photocatalytic water pollutant degradation,"To address the issues of water pollution and energy shortage, significant research has gone into the design of nanostructures with enhanced photocatalytic activity. In this paper, the photocatalyst Bi2S3/Bi/BiOI (BIS) was designed with both Z-scheme and heterojunction structures and successfully fabricated via a facile one-step solvothermal method. The as-synthesized BIS sample could quickly decompose the Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light irradiation within 30 min and demonstrated good reproducibility and cyclability. The low bandgap energy, large specific surface area, and the high oxidation/reduction potential of holes/electrons were key factors for the improved photocatalytic performance. The photogenerated h+ and ·O2− species played important roles in the degradation of RhB. The photocatalyst showed excellent, stable photocatalytic activity, and could be a candidate for environmental pollution remediation applications."
"Surface chemistry governs the sub-organ transfer, clearance and toxicity of functional gold nanoparticles in the liver and kidney","Background: To effectively applied nanomaterials (NMs) in medicine, one of the top priorities is to address a better understanding of the possible sub-organ transfer, clearance routes, and potential toxicity of the NMs in the liver and kidney. Results: Here we explored how the surface chemistry of polyethylene glycol (PEG), chitosan (CS), and polyethylenimine (PEI) capped gold nanoparticles (GNPs) governs their sub-organ biodistribution, transfer, and clearance profiles in the liver and kidney after intravenous injection in mice. The PEG-GNPs maintained dispersion properties in vivo, facilitating passage through the liver sinusoidal endothelium and Disse space, and were captured by hepatocytes and eliminated via the hepatobiliary route. While, the agglomeration/aggregation of CS-GNPs and PEI-GNPs in hepatic Kupffer and endothelial cells led to their long-term accumulation, impeding their elimination. The gene microarray analysis shows that the accumulation of CS-GNPs and PEI-GNPs in the liver induced obvious down-regulation of Cyp4a or Cyp2b related genes, suggesting CS-GNP and PEI-GNP treatment impacted metabolic processes, while the PEI-GNP treatment is related with immune responses. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that manipulation of nanoparticle surface chemistry can help NPs selectively access distinct cell types and elimination pathways, which help to clinical potential of non-biodegradable NPs."
The Future in Nanosafety,
Zero-Dimensional/Two-Dimensional Au<inf>x</inf>Pd<inf>100- x</inf> Nanocomposites with Enhanced Nanozyme Catalysis for Sensitive Glucose Detection,"Here, we report facile fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) Pd nanosheet (NS)-supported zero-dimensional (0D) Au nanoparticles via galvanic replacement. In the synthesis, the surface-clean Pd NSs premade not only acted as a sacrifice template for replacing Pd atoms by Au3+ ions, but served as a support substrate to support Au nanoparticles. The morphology, structure, and composition of products relied on the Au/Pd feed atomic ratio. Interestingly, the as-obtained 0D/2D AuxPd100-x (x = 4.5, 9.8, and 21) nanocomposites showed remarkably enhanced peroxidase-mimic catalysis in the model oxidation reaction, which followed the typical Michaelis-Menten theory. Compared to Pd NSs, the enhanced catalysis of AuxPd100-x was closely related to both the increased specific surface area and the modified electronic structure of Pd NSs, which resulted in a change in the catalytic pathway, that is, from hydroxyl radical generation to rapid electron transfer. The work provides a simple yet efficient avenue to build highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts based on metallic NSs, as exemplified by the superior nanozyme activity of 0D/2D bimetallic nanostructures for glucose detection."
Improved Nucleic Acid Therapy with Advanced Nanoscale Biotechnology,"Due to a series of systemic and intracellular obstacles in nucleic acid (NA) therapy, including fast degradation in blood, renal clearance, poor cellular uptake, and inefficient endosomal escape, NAs may need delivery methods to transport to the cell nucleus or cytosol to be effective. Advanced nanoscale biotechnology-associated strategies, such as controlling the particle size, charge, drug loading, response to environmental signals, or other physical/chemical properties of delivery carriers, have provided great help for the in vivo and in vitro delivery of NA therapeutics. In this review, we introduce the characteristics of different NA modalities and illustrate how advanced nanoscale biotechnology assists NA therapy. The specific features and challenges of various nanocarriers in clinical and preclinical studies are summarized and discussed. With the help of advanced nanoscale biotechnology, some of the major barriers to the development of NA therapy will eventually be overcome in the near future."
Recent advances in hydrogen generation process via hydrolysis of Mg-based materials: A short review,"Mg-based hydrolysis materials with high theoretical hydrogen production yield, abundant on earth, hydrolysis products environmentally friendly characteristics are regarded as promising hydrogen generation materials. Unfortunately, the quickly formed magnesium hydroxide layer hinders further contact of inside Mg with water in the hydrolysis process, leading to its sluggish hydrogen generation rate and low yield. This paper reviews the hydrogen generation measuring methods and recent progress on the modifications for hydrolysis of Mg-based systems, including adding different type additives, forming Mg-based alloys and tuning hydrolysis solutions. The hydrolysis mechanisms of these hydrolysis systems are summarized in the article."

Advances in nanotechnology-based strategies for the treatments of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects both upper and lower motor neurons, which results in loss of muscle control and eventual paralysis [1]. Currently, there are as yet unresolved challenges regarding efficient drug delivery into the central nervous system (CNS). These challenges can be attributed to multiple factors including the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB), as well as the inherent characteristics of the drugs themselves (e.g. low solubility, insufficient bioavailability/bio-stability, 'off-target' effects) etc. As a result, conventional drug delivery systems may not facilitate adequate dosage of the required drugs for functional recovery in ALS patients. Nanotechnology-based strategies, however, employ engineered nanostructures that show great potential in delivering single or combined therapeutic agents to overcome the biological barriers, enhance interaction with targeted sites, improve drug bioavailability/bio-stability and achieve real-time tracking while minimizing the systemic side-effects. This review provides a concise discussion of recent advances in nanotechnology-based strategies in relation to combating specific pathophysiology relevant to ALS disease progression and investigates the future scope of using nanotechnology to develop innovative treatments for ALS patients."
Cellular toxicity of multi-walled carbon nanotubes on human lung cells,"Nowadays, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are used in various industries. Considering the exposure probability of these nanomaterials to humans, the purpose of the present study is to assess the effect of MWCNTs on cellular toxicity of human alveolar epithelial. The A549 cells were cultured and treated to various doses of MWCNTs at three different times. Finally, the Tetrazolium colorimetric (MTT) assay was implemented for evaluating the cellular viability. The results indicated that the cytotoxicity for MWCNTs on the human alveolar epithelial cells is related to dose and time of exposure. The inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC50) and non-observed adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) are calculated to be 103.6 as well as 0.65μg/mL, respectively. The findings of this present study could contribute to a better understanding of MWCNTs substances and might be useful as a basis for the future risk evaluation studies of exposed population in industries."
"Scientific Events as Constitutive Characteristics of New Fields of Science and Research. The Example of the ""swiss NanoConvention""","Scientific events are rarely discussed in the formation and development of new fields of science. Using the example of the Swiss NanoConvention, it will be shown to what extent a long series of events shapes the Swiss nanosciences and is shaped by them. The convention offers the opportunity to both, present and legitimize new forms of science and research to heterogeneous publics, and to consolidate internal structures of the field. The analysis thus provides insight into the contours of nanoscience."
Improved sampling in ab initio free energy calculations of biomolecules at solid-liquid interfaces: Tight-binding assessment of charged amino acids on TiO<inf>2</inf> anatase (101),"Atomistic simulations can complement the scarce experimental data on free energies of molecules at bio-inorganic interfaces. In molecular simulations, adsorption free energy landscapes are efficiently explored with advanced sampling methods, but classical dynamics is unable to capture charge transfer and polarization at the solid-liquid interface. Ab initio simulations do not suffer from this flaw, but only at the expense of an overwhelming computational cost. Here, we introduce a protocol for adsorption free energy calculations that improves sampling on the timescales relevant to ab initio simulations. As a case study, we calculate adsorption free energies of the charged amino acids Lysine and Aspartate on the fully hydrated anatase (101) TiO2 surface using tight-binding forces. We find that the first-principle description of the system significantly contributes to the adsorption free energies, which is overlooked by calculations with previous methods."
Hemocompatibility testing of blood-contacting implants in a flow loop model mimicking human blood flow,"The growing use of medical devices (e.g., vascular grafts, stents, and cardiac catheters) for temporary or permanent purposes that remain in the body's circulatory system demands a reliable and multiparametric approach that evaluates the possible hematologic complications caused by these devices (i.e., activation and destruction of blood components). Comprehensive in vitro hemocompatibility testing of blood-contacting implants is the first step towards successful in vivo implementation. Therefore, extensive analysis according to the International Organization for Standardization 10993-4 (ISO 10993-4) is mandatory prior to clinical application. The presented flow loop describes a sensitive model to analyze the hemostatic performance of stents (in this case, neurovascular) and reveal adverse effects. The use of fresh human whole blood and gentle blood sampling are essential to avoid the preactivation of blood. The blood is perfused through a heparinized tubing containing the test specimen by using a peristaltic pump at a rate of 150 mL/min at 37 °C for 60 min. Before and after perfusion, hematologic markers (i.e., blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and plasmatic markers) indicating the activation of leukocytes (polymorphonuclear [PMN]-elastase), platelets (β-thromboglobulin [β-TG]), the coagulation system (thombin-antithrombin III [TAT]), and the complement cascade (SC5b-9) are analyzed. In conclusion, we present an essential and reliable model for extensive hemocompatibility testing of stents and other blood-contacting devices prior to clinical application."
Banning carbon nanotubes would be scientifically unjustified and damaging to innovation,
"Comparison of the level and mechanisms of toxicity of carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, and silicon nanotubes in bioassay with four marine microalgae","Nanoparticles (NPs) have various applications in medicine, cosmetics, optics, catalysis, environmental purification, and other areas nowadays. With an increasing annual production of NPs, the risks of their harmful influence to the environment and human health is rising. Currently, our knowledge about the mechanisms of interaction between NPs and living organisms is limited. Additionally, poor understanding of how physical and chemical characteristic and different conditions influence the toxicity of NPs restrict our attempts to develop the standards and regulations which might allow us to maintain safe living conditions. The marine species and their habitat environment are under continuous stress due to anthropogenic activities which result in the appearance of NPs in the aquatic environment. Our study aimed to evaluate and compare biochemical effects caused by the influence of different types of carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, and silica nanotubes on four marine microalgae species. We evaluated the changes in growth-rate, esterase activity, membrane polarization, and size changes of microalgae cells using flow cytometry method. Our results demonstrated that toxic effects caused by the carbon nanotubes strongly correlated with the content of heavy metal impurities in the NPs. More hydrophobic carbon NPs with less ordered structure had a higher impact on the red microalgae P. purpureum because of higher adherence between the particles and mucous covering of the algae. Silica NPs caused significant inhibition of microalgae growth-rate predominantly produced by mechanical influence."
Nutrient mTORC1 signaling contributes to hepatic lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,"Energy metabolism is maintained by the complex homeostatic system in multiple cells and organs involving “nutrient signaling” or “nutrient sensor”. Overnutrient-induced chronic metabolic diseases, as the hallmarks of the 21st century's public health, are growing threat worldwide. In the past two decades, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as the most prevalent form of chronic liver disease, affecting globally, and increases the risk of incident obesity, type 2 diabetes, and insulin resistance. NAFLD begins with the excessive triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes, and develops to hepatocellular steatosis with inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The liver is the central mediator of lipid metabolism by regulation of fatty acid (FA) uptake, manufacture, store, export, and oxidation in response to physiological fluctuations of nutrient. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein c (SREBP-1c)- mediated de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is an important nutritional regulator in biosynthesis of FAs and triglyceride in the liver. Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), as a central hub of nutrient signaling, controls cellular metabolism and growth mainly via increasing anabolic processes and inhibiting catabolic processes in response to physiological fluctuations of nutrient. mTORC1 activation contributes to regulation of DNL by increasing SREBP1 transcription, which contributes to NAFLD pathogenesis and accelerates NAFLD-related HCC development. In this review, we provide the comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanism of SREBPs and autophagy to control hepatic lipid homeostasis under nutrient availability in physiological and pathophysiological states, and highlight how nutrient mTORC1 signaling coordinately to integrate the lipid metabolic regulation and therapeutic targets in NAFLD and HCC."
Surface chemistry-dependent evolution of the nanomaterial corona on TiO<inf>2</inf> nanomaterials following uptake and sub-cellular localization,"Nanomaterial (NM) surface chemistry has an established and significant effect on interactions at the nano-bio interface, with important toxicological consequences for manufactured NMs, as well as potent effects on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of nano-therapies. In this work, the effects of different surface modifications (PVP, Dispex AA4040, and Pluronic F127) on the uptake, cellular distribution, and degradation of titanium dioxide NMs (TiO2 NMs, ~10 nm core size) are assessed and correlated with the localization of fluorescently-labeled serum proteins forming their coronas. Imaging approaches with an increasing spatial resolution, including automated high throughput live cell imaging, correlative confocal fluorescence and reflectance microscopy, and dSTORM super-resolution microscopy, are used to explore the cellular fate of these NMs and their associated serum proteins. Uncoated TiO2 NMs demonstrate a rapid loss of corona proteins, while surface coating results in the retention of the corona signal after internalization for at least 24 h (varying with coating composition). Imaging with two-color super-resolution dSTORM revealed that the apparent TiO2 NM single agglomerates observed in diffraction-limited confocal microscopy are actually adjacent smaller agglomerates, and provides novel insights into the spatial arrangement of the initial and exchanged coronas adsorbed at the NM surfaces."
"Investigation of recommended good practices to reduce exposure to nanomaterials in nanotechnology laboratories in Tehran, Iran","This study was conducted in nanotechnology laboratories in Tehran. A designed and validated questionnaire was used to meet the study goals. List of laboratories were provided through the Iran Nanotechnology Laboratory Network. All data were analyzed using SPSS.22. While 46.7% of the laboratories employed between 5 and 10 people on average, only 33.3% of them had a nanomaterial safety and health policy. In 80.0% of laboratories, nanomaterials were stored in labeled containers, while only 20.0% of laboratories were confident of the information on the labels. In terms of engineering controls, most laboratories had minimal controls (general ventilation and local ventilation). The laboratories also had minimal facilities in terms of personal protective equipment. As the research results indicated, the facilities for reducing and controlling exposure to hazardous substances have always been minimal in these laboratories. Most of them rely on minimal controls for various reasons, such as lack of technology, lack of funds, and lack of information. Finally, it is recommended to establish up-to-date control systems in research laboratories and ensure that appropriate personal protective equipment is provided and used properly."
3D-Printed Titanium Cage with PVA-Vancomycin Coating Prevents Surgical Site Infections (SSIs),"Many coating materials have been studied to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs). However, antibacterial coating on surfaces show weak adhesion using the traditional titanium (Ti) cage, resulting in low efficacy for preventing SSIs after spinal surgery. Herein, a 3D-printed Ti cage combined with a drug-releasing system is developed for in situ drug release and bacteria killing, leading to prevention of SSIs in vitro and in vivo. First, a 3D-printed Ti cage is designed and prepared by the Electron Beam Melting (EBM) method. Second, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) containing hydrophilic vancomycin hydrochloride (VH) is scattered across the surface of 3D-printed porous Ti (Ti-VH@PVA) cages. Ti-VH@PVA cages show an efficient drug-releasing profile and excellent bactericidal effect for three common bacteria after more than seven days in vitro. In addition, Ti-VH@PVA cages exhibit reliable inhibition of inflammation associated with Staphylococcus aureus and effective bone regeneration capacity in a rabbit model of SSIs. The results indicate that Ti-VH@PVA cages have potential advantages for preventing SSIs after spinal surgery."
Metal–Organic Frameworks for Biomedical Applications,"Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are an interesting and useful class of coordination polymers, constructed from metal ion/cluster nodes and functional organic ligands through coordination bonds, and have attracted extensive research interest during the past decades. Due to the unique features of diverse compositions, facile synthesis, easy surface functionalization, high surface areas, adjustable porosity, and tunable biocompatibility, MOFs have been widely used in hydrogen/methane storage, catalysis, biological imaging and sensing, drug delivery, desalination, gas separation, magnetic and electronic devices, nonlinear optics, water vapor capture, etc. Notably, with the rapid development of synthetic methods and surface functionalization strategies, smart MOF-based nanocomposites with advanced bio-related properties have been designed and fabricated to meet the growing demands of MOF materials for biomedical applications. This work outlines the synthesis and functionalization and the recent advances of MOFs in biomedical fields, including cargo (drugs, nucleic acids, proteins, and dyes) delivery for cancer therapy, bioimaging, antimicrobial, biosensing, and biocatalysis. The prospects and challenges in the field of MOF-based biomedical materials are also discussed."
ICG-Conjugated and <sup>125</sup>I-Labeled Polymeric Micelles with High Biosafety for Multimodality Imaging-Guided Photothermal Therapy of Tumors,"Noninvasive multimodality imaging-guided precision photothermal therapy (PTT) is proven to be an effective strategy for tumor theranostics by integrating diagnostics and therapeutics in one nanoplatform. In this study, indocyanine green (ICG)-conjugated and radionuclide iodine-125 (125I)-labeled polymeric micelles (PEG-PTyr(125I)-ICG PMs) are strategically prepared by the self-assembly of the ICG-decorated amphiphilic diblock polymer poly(ethylene glycol)–poly(l-tyrosine-125I)–(indocyanine green) (PEG-PTyr(125I)-ICG). The as-prepared polymeric micelles exhibit favorable biocompatibility, excellent size/photo/radiolabel stability, a high-photothermal conversion efficiency, a passive tumor-targeting ability, and a fluorescence (FL)/photoacoustic (PA)/single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging property. After tail intravenous injection, the polymeric micelles can efficiently accumulate at the tumor site and present comprehensive FL/PA/SPECT images with a high sensitivity, excellent spatial resolution, and unlimited tissue penetration under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation. Upon 808 nm laser irradiation, the subsequent precision PTT of tumors can be achieved with minimal cumulative side effects. Thus, this capable multifunctional nanoplatform with simple components and preparation procedures for FL/PA/SPECT multimodality imaging-guided PTT can be a potential candidate for clinical tumor theranostics."
Radiation-Induced Self-Assembly of Ti<inf>3</inf>C<inf>2</inf>T<inf>x</inf> with Improved Electrochemical Performance for Supercapacitor,"As a new family of 2D materials, MXenes have already shown a broad application prospect in energy storage. However, the inevitable restacking of MXene nanosheets always limits their performance. Here, a facile and environmentally friendly approach is developed to fabricate self-assembly Ti3C2Tx MXene (named SA-Ti3C2Tx) via γ-irradiation. The absorbed dose has obvious influence on the self-assembly of SA-Ti3C2Tx by changing the surface charge characteristics and groups to make the nanosheets assembled into large slices with different structure. At dose of 20 kGy, radiation-synthesized SA-Ti3C2Tx (SA-Ti3C2Tx-20) possesses the crumpled structure which exhibits larger specific surface area, enhanced conductivity, and larger specific capacitance, compared with those of original Ti3C2Tx. SA-Ti3C2Tx-20 also shows excellent rate performance and cycling stability. This study paves the way for the modification and assembly of MXenes with improved electrochemical performance."
Comparative analysis of lung and blood transcriptomes in mice exposed to multi-walled carbon nanotubes,"Pulmonary exposure to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) causes inflammation, fibroproliferation, immunotoxicity, and systemic responses in rodents. However, the search for representative biomarkers of exposure is an ongoing endeavor. Whole blood gene expression profiling is a promising new approach for the identification of novel disease biomarkers. We asked if the whole blood transcriptome reflects pathology-specific changes in lung gene expression caused by MWCNT. To answer this question, we performed mRNA sequencing analysis of the whole blood and lung in mice administered MWCNT or vehicle solution via pharyngeal aspiration and sacrificed 56 days later. The pattern of lung mRNA expression as determined using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was indicative of continued inflammation, immune cell trafficking, phagocytosis, and adaptive immune responses. Simultaneously, innate immunity-related transcripts (Plunc, Bpifb1, Reg3g) and cancer-related pathways were downregulated. IPA analysis of the differentially expressed genes in the whole blood suggested increased hematopoiesis, predicted activation of cancer/tumor development pathways, and atopy. There were several common upregulated genes between whole blood and lungs, important for adaptive immune responses: Cxcr1, Cd72, Sharpin, and Slc11a1. Trim24, important for TH2 cell effector function, was downregulated in both datasets. Hla-dqa1 mRNA was upregulated in the lungs and downregulated in the blood, as was Lilrb4, which controls the reactivity of immune response. “Cancer” disease category had opposing activation status in the two datasets, while the only commonality was “Hypersensitivity”. Transcriptome changes occurring in the lungs did not produce a completely replicable pattern in whole blood; however, specific systemic responses may be shared between transcriptomic profiles."
Caffeine Potentiates Ethanol-Induced Neurotoxicity Through mTOR/p70S6K/4E-BP1 Inhibition in SH-SY5Y Cells,"Caffeine is a popular psychostimulant, which is frequently consumed with ethanol. However, the effects of caffeine on neuronal cells constantly exposed to ethanol have not been investigated. Apoptosis and oxidative stress occurring in ethanol-induced neurotoxicity were previously associated with decreased phosphorylation of the mTOR/p70S6K/4E-BP1 signaling proteins. Evidence also suggested that caffeine inhibits the mTOR pathway. In this study, human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were exposed to caffeine after pretreatment for 24 hours with ethanol. Results indicated that both ethanol and caffeine caused neuronal cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Exposure to 20-mM caffeine for 24 hours magnified reduced cell viability and enhanced apoptotic cell death induced by 200 mM of ethanol pretreatment. The phosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1 markedly decreased in cells exposed to caffeine after ethanol pretreatment, associated with a decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). These findings suggested that caffeine treatment after neuronal cells were exposed to ethanol resulted in marked cell damages, mediated through enhanced inhibition of mTOR/p70S6K/4E-BP1 signaling leading to impaired ΔΨm and, eventually, apoptotic cell death."
Ultrasmall BiOI Quantum Dots with Efficient Renal Clearance for Enhanced Radiotherapy of Cancer,"Emerging strategies involving nanomaterials with high-atomic-number elements have been widely developed for radiotherapy in recent years. However, the concern regarding their potential toxicity caused by long-term body retention still limits their further application. In this regard, rapidly clearable radiosensitizers are highly desired for practical cancer treatment. Thus, in this work, ultrasmall BiOI quantum dots (QDs) with efficient renal clearance characteristic and strong permeability inside solid tumor are designed to address this issue. Additionally, considering that injection methods have great influence on the biodistribution and radiotherapeutic efficacy of radiosensitizers, two common injection methods including intratumoral injection and intravenous injection are evaluated. The results exhibit that intratumoral injection can maximize the accumulation of radiosensitizers within a tumor compared to intravenous injection and further enhance radiotherapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the radiosensitizing effect of BiOI QDs is revealed, which is not only attributed to the radiation enhancement of high-Z elements but also is owed to the •OH production via catalyzing overexpressed H2O2 within a tumor by BiOI QDs under X-ray irradiation. As a result, this work proposes a treatment paradigm to employ ultrasmall radiosensitizers integrated with local intratumoral injection to realize rapid clearance and high-efficiency radiosensitization for cancer therapy."
Effect of admixed solid inertants on dispersibility of combustible dust clouds in a modified hartmann tube,"Reduction of dust explosion hazards can be achieved by processing materials in less hazardous forms. Two principles are often employed to moderate explosion potential. One approach is to increase dust particle size so as to decrease its reactivity. The other involves altering the dust composition by admixture with solid inertants. An essential prerequisite for dust explosions is the formation of airborne dust clouds. Dust dispersibility (i.e., the ease of dispersion of a dust and the tendency of the particulate matter to remain airborne once a dust cloud has been formed) is therefore an important safety characteristic, certainly requiring research attention. This paper presents experimental results using a modified Hartmann tube to determine the effect of admixed solid inertants on particle size distribution of dust clouds. Nine types of combustible dust and two sizes of inert Al2O3 were tested repeatedly five times. Generally, admixing small amounts of micro-sized solid inertants caused relative improvement on the dispersibility of combustible dust, forming a better dispersed cloud, and sometimes resulted in increased ignition sensitivity. However, the addition of agglomerate nano inert particles caused a multilayer coating of combustible particles, causing an increase in the effective surface area at the particle contact points, and thereby increasing cohesion in the powder mixtures. Higher inter-particle forces in turn enhanced the combustible particle agglomeration during dispersion, leading to an increase in effective particle size distribution."
Acute oral methylmercury exposure perturbs the gut microbiome and alters gut-brain axis related metabolites in rats,"Environmental pollutants like methylmercury (MeHg) can bring devastating neurotoxicity to animals and human beings. Gut microbiota has been found to demethylate MeHg and promote the excretion of Hg through feces. However, the impacts of MeHg on gut microbiota and metabolites related to gut-brain interactions were less studied in mammals. The object of this study was to investigate the impacts of acute MeHg exposure on gut microbiome and metabolites together with its impact on gut integrity and related biological responses in rats. Rats were exposed to MeHg through oral administration and were sacrificed after 24 h 16 S rRNA gene sequencing was used to study the perturbance to gut microbiome and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used for metabolomics profiling. It was found that gut was one of the target tissues of MeHg. MeHg induce the changes of intestinal microbial community structure and induce the regulating neuron activity change of intestinal neurotransmitters and metabolites on intestinal neurotransmitters and metabolites regulating the neuron activity. This was supported by the increased BDNF level. These findings may suggest a potential new mechanism regarding the neurotoxicity of MeHg. The protocols used in this study may also be applied to understand the neurotoxicity of other environmental neurotoxins like Pb, Mn, polychlorinated biphenyls, and pesticides, etc and to screen the neurotoxicity of emerging environmental contaminants."
Silver nanoparticles regulate Arabidopsis root growth by concentration-dependent modification of reactive oxygen species accumulation and cell division,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used in industry, increasing their potential level in the environment. Plant root, the key organ absorbing water and nutrients, are directly exposed to the soil. Little is known about AgNP-mediated effects on plant root growth. Here, we show that AgNPs are absorbed by root and mostly localized in cell wall and intercellular spaces, which affect root growth in a dose-dependent manner. Increased root elongation was observed when Arabidopsis was exposed to an AgNP concentration of 50 mg L-1, while decreased elongation was observed at concentrations of equal to or more than 100 mg L-1. Similarly, there was an increase in the number of cells in the root apical meristem and also in cell-cycle related gene expression (CYCB1;1) at 50 mg L-1 AgNP, while both cell number and gene expression declined at concentrations equal to or more than 100 mg L-1. This indicates that AgNPs regulate root growth by affecting cell division. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) related genes were deferentially expressed after 50 mg L-1 AgNP treatment. Further studies showed that AgNPs induce ROS accumulation in root tips in a dose-dependent manner. KI treatment, which scavenges H2O2, partially rescued AgNP-inhibited root growth. The application 50 mg L-1 AgNPs also rescued the root length phenotype of upb1-1, a mutant with slightly higher ROS levels and longer root length. Our results revealed that ROS mediate the dose-dependent effects of AgNPs on root growth. These findings provide new insights into mechanisms underlying how AgNPs regulate root growth in Arabidopsis."
Silica nanoparticles induce caspase-dependent apoptosis through reactive oxygen species-activated endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway in neuronal cells,"Human exposure to silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) has been widely applied as vehicles for drug delivery and cellular manipulations in nanoneuromedicine. SiNPs may cause adverse effects in the brain, but potential mechanisms underlying SiNPs-induced neurotoxicity are remained unclear. Here, we examined cytotoxic effects and the cellular mechanisms of SiNPs-induced neuronal cell death. In this study, the results showed that SiNPs significantly decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis in Neuro-2a cells as evidenced by the increase caspase-3 activity and the activation of caspase cascades and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). In addition, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was triggered as indicated by several key molecules including glucose-regulated protein (GRP)78 and 94, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), activation transcription factor (ATF)-4, and caspase-12. Pretreatment of Neuro-2a cells with specific pharmacological inhibitor of ER stress (4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA)) effectively alleviated the SiNPs-induced ER stress and apoptotic related signals. Furthermore, 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescein fluorescence as an indicator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation after exposure of Neuro-2a cells to SiNPs significantly increased ROS levels. Antioxidant N-acetylcyseine (NAC) effectively reversed SiNPs-induced cellular responses. Taken together, these results suggest that SiNPs exposure exerts its neurotoxicity in cultured neuronal cells by inducing apoptosis via a ROS generation-activated downstream ER stress signaling pathway."
Paramagnetic properties adjustment for Gd@C<inf>2v</inf>(9)-C<inf>82</inf> by regioselective multi-amination,"The electron spin characters of paramagnetic endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) are sensitive to their surroundings, which offer an opportunity to manipulate their paramagnetic properties. Here we reported the amination of paramagnetic Gd@C82 and revealed that morpholine groups can be used as a tool to fine-tune properties of Gd@C82. Changes of their paramagnetic properties have been observed under different temperatures and among three derivatives. Addition of morpholine groups eliminates the single unpaired electron on the carbon cage, and causes lower symmetry of the carbon cage and location limit of encapsulated gadolinium, leading serious restriction of Gd@C82 and gadolinium motion. The high sensitivity of spin population to chemical modification offers us the possibility to investigate the spin qubit property and further realize quantum control on a molecular level."
Adsorption and coadsorption of single and multiple natural organic matter on Ag (1 1 1) surface: A DFT-D study,"The nature of the interaction of low molecular weight natural organic matter (NOM) with the Ag (1 1 1) surface is of crucial importance in the environment. The low molecular weight organics used in this study are formic acid (FA), acetic acid (AA1) and ascorbic acid (AA2). In this study, we think of a realistic environment where single, multiple or even a mixture of NOM's can attach on one Ag (1 1 1) surface. Such critical information is relevant in order to understand the behaviour of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) when they get into the environment. To bridge this gap, we investigate the adsorption and co-adsorption properties of NOM's on Ag (1 1 1) surface using dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) in the gas phase and water as a solvent. Throughout this paper, the number behind the letter represents the number of molecules i.e. nFA, nAA1, nAA2 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4). The results of the calculated adsorption energy suggest that the interaction of 4FA, 2AA1 and 2AA2 molecules with Ag (1 1 1) surface is the strongest with the most negative values (−6.54 and −3.84 eV) in both gas phase and COSMO respectively which reveals that is the most stable system. The global reactivity descriptors in the gas phase and water as a solvent were calculated."
Potential application development of Sr/HCOOH metal organic framework in osteoarthritis,"Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are widely used in various engineering applications, including energy storage, chemical catalysis, etc. However, their potential functions in disease therapy, especially alkaline-earth based MOFs, still need to be developed. In this study, Sr/HCOOH-MOF is successfully prepared and characterized by using XRD, FTIR, TGA, SEM and BET. Drug loading and releasing experiments proved that only 3% ketoprofen was loaded on the Sr/HCOOH-MOF and approximately 80% ketoprofen was released from it after 8 h. Moreover, the potential application of Sr/HCOOH-MOF on attenuating osteoarthritis is evaluated in vitro. Sr/HCOOH-MOF is biocompatible within given doses. Furthermore, it can significantly inhibit the gene expression of IL-1β, iNOS and RANKL. Therefore, Sr/HCOOH-MOF could be a promising compound for attenuating osteoarthritis more than a drug delivery system."
The role of sex in particle-induced inflammation and injury,"The use of engineered nanomaterials within various applications such as medicine, electronics, and cosmetics has been steadily increasing; therefore, the rate of occupational and environmental exposures has also increased. Inhalation is an important route of exposure to nanomaterials and has been shown to cause various respiratory diseases in animal models. Human lung disease frequently presents with a sex/gender-bias in prevalence or severity, but investigation of potential sex-differences in the adverse health outcomes associated with nanoparticle inhalation is greatly lacking. Only ~20% of basic research in the general sciences use both male and female animals and a substantial percentage of these do not address differences between sexes within their analyses. This has prevented researchers from fully understanding the impact of sex-based variables on health and disease, particularly the pathologies resulting from the inhalation of particles. The mechanisms responsible for sex-differences in respiratory disease remain unclear, but could be related to a number of variables including sex-differences in hormone signaling, lung physiology, or respiratory immune function. By incorporating sex-based analysis into respiratory nanotoxicology and utilizing human data from other relevant particles (e.g., asbestos, silica, particulate matter), we can improve our understanding of sex as a biological variable in nanoparticle exposures. This article is categorized under: Toxicology and Regulatory Issues in Nanomedicine > Toxicology of Nanomaterials."
Switchable Ionic Rectifiers Based on Ferroelectric Nanopores,"A switchable ionic rectifier composed of an array of ferroelectric polymer nanopore structures was demonstrated. The ferroelectric polarization established an asymmetric potential and ionic charge distribution, which couples to the movement of ionic charges through nanopores and leads to unidirectional current flow or rectification. This rectifier is stable, with rectification characteristics maintained for at least tens of hours, does not require chemical functionalization of nanopores, and, importantly, can reversibly switch the current-rectifying direction by electrical tuning of the ferroelectric polarization states. Finally, reconfigurable nanofluidic logic circuits, specifically, a few types of basic ""AND"" and ""OR"" gates, are assembled."
Engineering of Upconverted Metal-Organic Frameworks for Near-Infrared Light-Triggered Combinational Photodynamic/Chemo-/Immunotherapy against Hypoxic Tumors,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown great potential as nanophotosensitizers (nPSs) for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The use of such MOFs in PDT, however, is limited by the shallow depth of tissue penetration of short-wavelength light and the oxygen-dependent mechanism that renders it inadequate for hypoxic tumors. Here, to combat such limitations, we rationally designed core-shell upconversion nanoparticle@porphyrinic MOFs (UCSs) for combinational therapy against hypoxic tumors. The UCSs were synthesized in high yield through the conditional surface engineering of UCNPs and subsequent seed-mediated growth strategy. The heterostructure allows efficient energy transfer from the UCNP core to the MOF shell, which enables the near-infrared (NIR) light-triggered production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. A hypoxia-activated prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ) was encapsulated in nanopores of the MOF shell of the heterostructures to yield the final construct TPZ/UCSs. We demonstrated that TPZ/UCSs represent a promising system for achieving improved cancer treatment in vitro and in vivo via the combination of NIR light-induced PDT and hypoxia-activated chemotherapy. Furthermore, the integration of the nanoplatform with antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 (α-PD-L1) treatment promotes the abscopal effect to completely inhibit the growth of untreated distant tumors by generating specific tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T cells. Collectively, this work highlights a robust nanoplatform for combining NIR light-triggered PDT and hypoxia-activated chemotherapy with immunotherapy to combat the current limitations of tumor treatment."
"Highly Transparent, Highly Thermally Stable Nanocellulose/Polymer Hybrid Substrates for Flexible OLED Devices","Flexible organic light-emitting diode (OLED) devices based on polymer substrates have attracted worldwide attention. However, the current OLED polymer substrates are limited due to weak thermal stability, which is not compatible with the high temperature in OLED fabrication. Here, we developed a novel nanocellulose/polyarylate (PAR) hybrid polymer substrate with both high transparency and excellent thermal properties. Benefiting from the nanometer scale of the cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and the efficient interfacial interaction with PAR, the substrate exhibited greatly improved thermal stability, with a glass transition temperature of 192 °C, the thermal decomposition temperature of 501 °C, and upper operating temperature up to over 220 °C. Meanwhile, the hybrid substrate exhibits outstanding mechanical properties. Notably, no apparent transparency loss was observed after the CNF addition, and the hybrid substrate maintains a high transmittance of 85% and a low haze of 1.75%@600 nm. Moreover, OLED devices fabricated on the hybrid substrates exhibit a much improved optoelectrical performance than that of the devices fabricated on the conventional poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates. We anticipate this research will open up a new route for fabricating flexible high-performance OLEDs."
Near-Infrared Light-Activated Phototherapy by Gold Nanoclusters for Dispersing Biofilms,"A bacterial biofilm is strongly associated with chronic infections and is difficult to be eradicated, posing serious threats to public health. Development of effective therapeutic strategies to prevent and control hospital-acquired infections via eradication of bacteria shielded by biofilms is challenging. Herein, we developed deoxyribonuclease (DNase)-functionalized gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) (DNase-AuNCs), which are capable of killing Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, especially dispersing the surrounding biofilms. The DNase can break down the extracellular polymeric substance matrix to expose the defenseless bacteria to photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) by DNase-AuNCs under 808 nm laser irradiation. The combination of enzymolysis, PDT, and PTT can effectively remove biofilms with a dispersion rate of up to 80% and kill ∼90% of the shielded bacteria. DNase-AuNCs exhibit an outstanding therapeutic effect in treating bacterial biofilm-coated orthodontic devices (Invisalign aligners), suggesting their potential applications in medical devices."
Graphene Oxide-Grafted Magnetic Nanorings Mediated Magnetothermodynamic Therapy Favoring Reactive Oxygen Species-Related Immune Response for Enhanced Antitumor Efficacy,"In this study, a magnetothermodynamic (MTD) therapy is introduced as an efficient systemic cancer treatment, by combining the magnetothermal effect and the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related immunologic effect, in order to overcome the obstacle of limited therapeutic efficacy in current magnetothermal therapy (MTT). This approach was achieved by the development of an elaborate ferrimagnetic vortex-domain iron oxide nanoring and graphene oxide (FVIOs-GO) hybrid nanoparticle as the efficient MTD agent. Such a FVIOs-GO nanoplatform was shown to have high thermal conversion efficiency, and it was further proved to generate a significantly amplified ROS level under an alternating magnetic field (AMF). Both in vitro and in vivo results revealed that amplified ROS generation was the dominant factor in provoking a strong immune response at a physiological tolerable temperature below 40 °C in a hypoxic tumor microenvironment. This was supported by the exposure of calreticulin (CRT) on 83% of the 4T1 breast cancer cell surface, direct promotion of macrophage polarization to pro-inflammatory M1 phenotypes, and further elevation of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes. As a result of the dual action of magnetothermal effect and ROS-related immunologic effect, impressive in vivo systemic therapeutic efficacy was attained at a low dosage of 3 mg Fe/kg with two AMF treatments, as compared to that of MTT (high dosage of 6-18 mg/kg under four to eight AMF treatments). The MTD therapy reported here has highlighted the inadequacy of conventional MTT that solely relies on the heating effect of the MNPs. Thus, by employing a ROS-mediated immunologic effect, future cancer magnetotherapies can be designed with greatly improved antitumor capabilities."
Two-Dimensional Tin Selenide (SnSe) Nanosheets Capable of Mimicking Key Dehydrogenases in Cellular Metabolism,"While dehydrogenases play crucial roles in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle of cell metabolism, which are extensively explored for biomedical and chemical engineering uses, it is a big challenge to overcome the shortcomings (low stability and high costs) of recombinant dehydrogenases. Herein, it is shown that two-dimensional (2D) SnSe is capable of mimicking native dehydrogenases to efficiently catalyze hydrogen transfer from 1-(R)-2-(R′)-ethanol groups. In contrary to susceptible native dehydrogenases, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) for instance, SnSe is extremely tolerant to reaction condition changes (pH, temperature, and organic solvents) and displays extraordinary reusable capability. Structure–activity analysis indicates that the single-atom structure, Sn vacancy, and hydrogen binding affinity of SnSe may be responsible for their catalytic activity. Overall, this is the first report of a 2D SnSe nanozyme to mimic key dehydrogenases in cell metabolism."
The effect of size and surface ligands of iron oxide nanoparticles on blood compatibility,"Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have been widely used and have attracted increased attention for their unique physicochemical properties, especially in biomedical sciences as contrast agents following intravenous administration. However, only few studies have systematically reported the blood compatibility of iron oxide nanoparticles with different physicochemical properties such as different sizes and surface ligands. Therefore, we selected three widely used organic ligands (polyacrylic acid, hyaluronic acid, and chitosan) with modified SPIONs at the same size of 5-6 nm, and polyacrylic acid-modified SPIONs with different sizes (5, 10, and 30 nm) at different concentrations to evaluate their haemocompatibility. Our results revealed that SPIONs modified with polyacrylic acid demonstrated size-dependent destruction of red blood cells and complement activation. Interestingly, 5 nm SPIONs prolonged blood clotting time as compared with 10 nm and 30 nm SPIONs in vitro. Compared with polyacrylic acid-modified SPIONs, hyaluronic acid- and chitosan-modified SPIONs least affected red blood cells, platelets, coagulation, and complement activation. Hence, hyaluronic acid- and chitosan-coated SPIONs are more suitable for nanomedicine applications than polyacrylic acid-coated SPIONs. Furthermore, the interaction between SPIONs and blood components strongly correlated with the administered concentration of nanoparticles. These results will provide some experimental information for safe-by-design SPIONs."
Quality of physicochemical data on nanomaterials: An assessment of data completeness and variability,"Grouping and read-across has emerged as a reliable approach to generate safety-related data on nanomaterials (NMs). However, its successful implementation relies on the availability of detailed characterisation of NM physicochemical properties, which allows the definition of groups based on read-across similarity. To this end, this study assessed the availability and completeness of existing (meta)data on 11 experimentally determined physicochemical properties and 18 NMs. Data on representative NMs were mainly extracted from existing datasets stored in the eNanoMapper database, now available on the European Observatory on Nanomaterials website, while data on case-study NMs were provided by their industrial manufacturers. The extent of available (meta)data was assessed and data gaps were identified, thereby determining future testing needs. Data completeness was assessed by using the information checklists included in the templates for data logging developed by the EU-funded projects NANoREG and GRACIOUS. A completeness score (CS) between 0 and 1 was calculated for each (meta)data unit, template section, property, technique and NM. The results show a heterogeneous distribution of available (meta)data across materials and properties, with none of the selected NMs fully characterised. The average CS calculated for representative NMs (0.43) was considerably lower than for case-study NMs (0.68). The low CS was largely caused by missing information on sample preparation and standard operating procedures, and was attributed to a lack of harmonised data reporting and entry procedure. This study therefore suggests that a persistent use of well-defined and harmonised reporting schemes for experimental results is a useful tool to increase (meta)data completeness and ensure their integration and reuse."
Insights into the epigenetic effects of nanomaterials on cells,"With the development of nanotechnology, nanomaterials are increasingly being applied in health fields, such as biomedicine, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. Concerns have therefore been raised over their toxicity and numerous studies have been carried out to assess their safety. Most studies on the toxicity and therapeutic mechanisms of nanomaterials have revealed the effects of nanomaterials on cells at the transcriptome and proteome levels. However, epigenetic modifications, for example DNA methylation, histone modification, and noncoding RNA expression induced by nanomaterials, which play an important role in the regulation of gene expression, have not received sufficient attention. In this review, we therefore state the importance of studying epigenetic effects induced by nanomaterials; then we review the progress of nanomaterial epigenetic research in the assessment of toxicity, therapeutic, and other mechanisms. We also clarify the possible study directions for future nanomaterial epigenetic research. Finally, we discuss the future development and challenges of nanomaterial epigenetics that must still be addressed. We hope to understand the potential toxicity of nanomaterials and clearly understand the therapeutic mechanism through a thorough investigation of nanomaterial epigenetics."
The high permeability of nanocarriers crossing the enterocyte layer by regulation of the surface zonal pattern,"The intestinal epithelium is a major barrier that limits the absorption of oral drugs. The integrity of the epithelial tissue is a very important factor for preventing intestinal diseases. However, destabilization of the epithelium can promote the transportation of nanocarriers and increase the absorption of oral drugs. In our research, three different gold nanoparticles (GNPs) of the same size but with differing negative surface charge were designed and constructed as a model to determine the surface properties crucial for promoting absorptivity and bioavailability of the nanocarriers. The higher the ratio of surface carboxyl groups on GNPs, the higher capacity to induce transepithelial electrical resistance change and cell monolayer tight junction opening with higher permeability. The half carboxyl and half methyl surfaced GNPs displayed unique zonal surface patterns exhibited the greater ability to pass through intestinal epithelial cell layer but had a relatively small influence on tight junction distribution."
An inverse cell culture model for floating plastic particles,"Plastic waste has become a major environmental problem. An increasing number of studies investigate microplastic particles with regard to their uptake and effects in cell culture systems. Individual plastic materials vary in their molecular structure, composition, size distribution, material density, and may also differ with respect to their toxicological effects. Plastic particles with lower densities than the cell culture medium, for example polyethylene (PE), pose a particular problem for in vitro assays as they float up during the incubation and thus do not contact the cells located on the bottom of the culture dish. We thus developed a practical and easy-to-use in vitro inverse cell culture model for investigating cellular effects of floating plastic particles. Cytotoxicity tests with floating PE particles were performed to demonstrate the utility of the inverted cell model. PE particles incubated in overhead culture were cytotoxic to HepG2 cells, while under the same cultivation conditions, except for inversion, no cytotoxicity occurred. These positive results demonstrate that inverted cell culture was required to detect the effects of PE particles and underlines the necessity to adapt cell culture conditions to the physicochemical properties of particles in order to obtain a more accurate estimate of the effects of floating particles on cells."
Engineered Nanomaterials and Type I Allergic Hypersensitivity Reactions,"Type I allergic hypersensitivity disorders (atopy) including asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy are on the rise in developed and developing countries. Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) span a large spectrum of material compositions including carbonic, metals, polymers, lipid-based, proteins, and peptides and are being utilized in a wide range of industries including healthcare and pharmaceuticals, electronics, construction, and food industry, and yet, regulations for the use of ENMs in consumer products are largely lacking. Prior evidence has demonstrated the potential of ENMs to induce and/or aggravate type I allergic hypersensitivity responses. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that ENMs could directly interact with and activate key T-helper 2 (Th2) effector cell types (such as mast cells) and the complement system, which could result in pseudoallergic (non-IgE-mediated) hypersensitivity reactions. Nevertheless, the underlying molecular mechanisms of ENM-mediated induction and/or exacerbation of type I immune responses are poorly understood. In this review, we first highlight key examples of studies that have demonstrated inherent immunomodulatory properties of ENMs in the context of type I allergic hypersensitivity reactions, and most importantly, we attempt to put together the potential molecular mechanisms that could drive ENM-mediated stimulation and/or aggravation of type I allergic hypersensitivity responses."
Elucidating the mechanisms underlying PCBM enhancement of CH<inf>3</inf>NH<inf>3</inf>PbI<inf>3</inf> perovskite solar cells using GIXRD and XAFS,"In this study, the stability mechanism of the optimized methyl ammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3, MAPbI3)/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) perovskite active layer upon exposure to moisture, light, and heating was investigated. For the first time, the existence of high-valence lead arising from PCBM is confirmed by X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (XAFS) based on synchrotron radiation, which helps to form stronger Pb-I bonds and facilitate carrier transport. Moreover, the degree of disorder of perovskites and the [PbI6]4- octahedral distortion are significantly improved, as well as the crystallization both on the surface and in the bulk. The result of this study provides a fundamental understanding of the functions of additives with electron-withdrawing properties (e.g., PCBM) in perovskite materials and could specifically be extended to systematically design and fabricate high-efficiency and stable solar cells."
Carboxylated gold nanoparticles inhibit bone erosion by disturbing the acidification of an osteoclast absorption microenvironment,"Hyperactive osteoclasts (OCs) are a fundamental reason for excessive bone resorption and consequent osteoporosis that lead to one-third of the patients sustaining a fracture. OCs, with the help of acidifying vesicles containing vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), transport cytoplasmic protons into a resorptive pit and create an acidic microenvironment where proteolytic enzymes degrade the bone matrix. Here, we report a previously undescribed application of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to inhibit excessive bone resorption by regulating the acidic microenvironment in which OCs resorb bone. Internalized AuNPs, with relatively abundant carboxyl groups, eventually accumulate in the membrane of the intracellular vesicles and interact with the V0 domain of V-ATPase, which prevents it from recruiting the V1 domain. This destroys the acid-secretion function of OCs. The therapeutic effect of AuNPs on bone resorption was assessed in an established lipopolysaccharide-induced bone erosion mouse model. Micro-computed tomography, histology, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining showed that AuNPs significantly reduced bone erosion. In summary, AuNPs are promising nano-functional materials for repairing bone defects by regulating OC acid secretion."
Highly potent intradermal vaccination by an array of dissolving microneedle polypeptide cocktails for cancer immunotherapy,"Despite recent advances in cancer therapy using vaccines, the efficacy of vaccine regimens remains to be improved. Cutaneous transportation of biomolecules, particularly DNA vaccines, has potentially improved the therapeutic efficacy and has been found to be an appealing approach in cancer immunotherapy. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of transdermal vaccination is limited by the lack of efficacious immune stimulation. Here, to elicit strong immunogenicity in target cells, we propose an array of dissolving microneedle cocktails for pain-free implantation and triggered release of vaccines and adjuvants at cutaneous tissues. The microneedle cocktails comprising a bioresorbable polypeptide matrix with a nanopolyplex, which include cationic amphiphilic conjugates with ovalbumin-expressing plasmid OVA (pOVA) and immunostimulant-polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), were prepared using a one-pot synthesis. The cationic nanopolyplex effectively transported pOVA and poly(I:C) into the intracellular compartments of dendritic cells and macrophages. Cutaneous implantation of microneedle cocktails on mice elicits a stronger antigen-specific antibody response than subcutaneous administration of the microneedle-free nanopolyplex. Compared with traditional vaccination, the dissolving microneedle cocktails enhanced the antibody recall memory after challenge; remarkably, the cocktail-based therapeutic vaccination also resulted in enhanced lung clearance of cancer cells. The dissolving microneedle cocktail therapy based on the triggered release of immunomodulators and adjuvants synergistically augmented the therapeutic effect in B16/OVA melanoma tumors."
Tumor Microenvironment-Responsive Theranostic Nanoplatform for in Situ Self-Boosting Combined Phototherapy through Intracellular Reassembly,"Through rational design, in vivo supramolecular construction of nanodrugs could precisely proceed in the lesion areas, which may apparently improve the theranostic performance of nanomaterials. Herein, a tumor microenvironment-responsive theranostic nanoplatform (Ce6-GA@MnO2-HA-PEG) has been constructed to achieve in vivo supramolecular construction and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of combined phototherapy through intracellular reassembly. Under the tumor microenvironment, such nanoplatform could undergo the process of decomposition-reassembly and form in situ photothermal assemblies. The generation of assemblies would endow this nanoplatform with the capacity of photothermal therapy. Meanwhile, this nanoplatform could alleviate hypoxia and improve the therapeutic efficacy of photodynamic therapy. The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments reveal that tumors can be ablated efficiently by the designed nanoplatform under laser irradiation. In addition, fluorescence imaging and magnetic resonance imaging can be activated by the decomposition of MnO2 to realize tumor imaging in vivo. Therefore, this multifunctional nanoplatform exhibits the capacity for boosting dual-modal imaging-guided combined phototherapy through intracellular reassembly, which may propose a new thought in cancer theranostics."
Elucidating the Nature of the Cu(I) Active Site in CuO/TiO<inf>2</inf> for Excellent Lowerature CO Oxidation,"Stabilized Cu+ species have been widely considered as catalytic active sites in composite copper catalysts for catalytic reactions with industrial importance. However, few examples comprehensively explicated the origin of stabilized Cu+ in a low-cost and widely investigated CuO/TiO2 system. In this study, mass producible CuO/TiO2 catalysts with interface-stabilized Cu+ were prepared, which showed excellent lowerature CO oxidation activity. A thorough characterization and theoretical calculations proved that the strong charge-transfer effect and Ti-O-Cu hybridization in Ti-doped CuO(111) at the CuO/TiO2 interface contributed to the formation and stabilization of Cu+ species. The CO molecule adsorbed on Cu+ and reacted directly with Ti doping-promoted active lattice oxygen via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, leading to the enhanced lowerature activity."
Photothermal-Promoted Morphology Transformation in Vivo Monitored by Photoacoustic Imaging,"The in situ construction of the nanoassembly has been demonstrated to improve the performance of bioactive molecules, but the control of the morphology of nanomaterials in vivo still remains a tremendous challenge. Herein, a photothermal-promoted morphology transformation (PMT) strategy is developed to accelerate the formation of nanomaterials for improving the biological performance of drug molecules. Compared with the spontaneous process, the rate of transformation increases by â 4 times in the PMT process. Owing to increased assembly rate, the tumor accumulation of drugs is â 2-fold than that without photo irradiation, which inhibits tumor growth effectively. More importantly, the chemical reassembly process in vitro and in vivo is monitored by the advanced ratiometric photoacoustic image, confirming the photoinduced transformation acceleration. Through the noninvasively artificial control on assembly dynamics in vivo, the PMT strategy provides a new insight for developing the intelligent theranostics."
Time-Resolved Activation of pH Sensing and Imaging in Vivo by a Remotely Controllable DNA Nanomachine,"Construction of probes or nanodevices capable of sensing pH with high spatial and temporal precision remains a challenge, despite their importance in monitoring of diverse physiological and pathological processes. Here we disclose the first remotely and noninvasively controlled DNA nanomachine that can monitor pH in live cells and animals in a temporally programmable manner. The nanomachine is designed by rational engineering of the DNA motif with a light-responsive element and further combination with an upconversion nanoparticle that works as a transducer to manipulate the nanomachine with the high precision of NIR light. The nanomachine not only allows for activated fluorescent imaging of intracellular pH, but it also can exert spatiotemporal control over its pH sensing activity in tumor-bearing mice by NIR light irradiation at a chosen time and place. This work illustrates the potential of combining DNA nanotechnology with upconversion tools to yield a precisely controlled nanomachine for temporally resolved pH sensing and imaging."
MnO<inf>2</inf>/Carbon Composites for Supercapacitor: Synthesis and Electrochemical Performance,"As an emerging energy storage device, the supercapacitor with high energy density, fast charging/discharging, and good cycle stability has aroused great interest. The performance of supercapacitors mainly depend on the electrode material. Manganese dioxide (MnO2) has emerged as one of the most promising electrode materials for high theoretical specific capacitance, wide potential range, high electrochemical activity, and environmental friendliness. However, its deteriorated volume expansion and inherently low conductivity limit its development and application in supercapacitors. To circumvent the mentioned issues, the porous, thin film, or layered composite materials were prepared to enhance the electrical conductivity and specific surface area of MnO2. Carbon materials are the ideal choice to compound with MnO2 owing to their low electrical resistance, significant thermal stability, large specific surface area, and porosity. Up to now, several kinds of MnO2/carbon composites as supercapacitor electrodes have been designed and fabricated. Herein, we give a concise review of the latest researches on MnO2/carbon supercapacitor electrodes, focusing on the fabrication strategies and analyzing the influencing factors of electrochemical performance of MnO2/carbon materials. An outlook on the possible development directions in future of designing high-performance MnO2/carbon materials for the current challenges is also provided."
A liquid metal composite by ZIF-8 encapsulation,A new composite material positioning a liquid metal core within a zeolitic imidazolate framework shell is developed. The core-shell interactions along with the structure/properties of the composite material can be easily regulated by the ligand/metal ion ratio. Enhanced photothermal conversion of the liquid metal core is achieved after ZIF-8 encapsulation.
Gold Nanoclusters-Coated Orthodontic Devices Can Inhibit the Formation of Streptococcus mutans Biofilm,"Oral health is an issue that has attracted increasing attention recently. Poor oral hygiene may induce the formation of oral biofilm on orthodontic devices, and cause gingivitis and dental caries. Here, we present a strategy for modifying orthodontic devices (e.g., invisalign aligner) with quaternary ammonium (QA)-modified gold nanoclusters (QA-GNCs) as an antibiotic reagent to prevent bacterial contamination and biofilm formation. The QA-GNCs-coated aligner can efficiently inhibit the adhesion of cariogenic pathogenic Streptococcus mutans and the formation of biofilm. Moreover, the antibacterial activity of the coated QA-GNCs can be maintained for at least 3 months and after repeated usage (>3 cycles). Furthermore, the QA-GNCs coating shows excellent biosafety confirmed by the cell viability test, the hemolysis assay, and animal experiments. Our strategy for antibacterial coating has the advantages of broad applications, low cost, good stability, high antibacterial efficiency, good biocompatibility, and low risk of antibiotic contamination, which could be particularly useful in preventing infections involving implantable medical devices or wearable electronics."
Nd<sup>3+</sup>-Sensitized Upconversion Metal–Organic Frameworks for Mitochondria-Targeted Amplified Photodynamic Therapy,"Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a mitochondria-specific, 808 nm NIR light-activated photodynamic therapy (PDT) system based on the combination of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and upconversion photochemistry with an organelle-targeting strategy. The system was synthesized through the growth of a porphyrinic MOF on Nd3+-sensitized upconversion nanoparticles to achieve Janus nanostructures with further asymmetric functionalization of the surface of the MOF domain. The PDT nanoplatform allows for photosensitizing with 808 nm NIR light, which could effectively avoid the laser-irradiation-induced overheating effect. Furthermore, mitochondria-targeting could amplify PDT efficacy through the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and the initiation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway. This work sheds light on the hybrid engineering of MOFs to combat their current limitations for PDT."
Relative potency factor approach enables the use of in vitro information for estimation of human effect factors for nanoparticle toxicity in life-cycle impact assessment,"The major theme of the NRC report “Toxicity Testing in the Twenty-first Century” is to replace animal testing by using alternative in vitro methods. Therefore, it can be expected that in the future in vivo data will be replaced with in vitro data. Hence, there is a need for new strategies to make use of the increasing amount of in vitro data when developing human toxicological effect factors (HEF) to characterize the impact category of human toxicity in life cycle assessment (LCA). Here, we present a new approach for deriving HEF for manufactured nanomaterials (MNMs) based on the combined use of in vitro toxicity data and a relative potency factor (RPF) approach. In vitro toxicity tests with nano-CuO, nano-Ag and nano-ZnO and their corresponding ions were performed on THP-1, CaCo-2 and Hep-G2 cell lines. The ratio of the here calculated EC50 of the ionic form and the nanoform corresponds to the Relative Potency Factor (RPF). Using this approach, HEFs (case/kgintake) for the aforementioned nanoparticles were obtained. Non-carcinogenic HEFs (case/kgintake) for exposure via ingestion of 5.9E-01, 7.5E-03 and 2.5 E-02 were calculated for nano-Ag, nano-CuO and nano-ZnO, respectively. The HEF values here proposed were compared with HEF values extrapolated from in vivo toxicity data reported in the literature. The here presented procedure is the most appropriate approximation currently available for using in vitro toxicity data on MNM for application in the field of LCIA."
A multi-omics approach reveals mechanisms of nanomaterial toxicity and structure–activity relationships in alveolar macrophages,"In respect to the high number of released nanomaterials and their highly variable properties, novel grouping approaches are required based on the effects of nanomaterials. Proper grouping calls for a combination of an experimental setup with a higher number of structurally similar nanomaterials and for employing integrated omics approaches to identify the mode of action. Here, we analyzed the effects of seven well-characterized NMs comprising different chemical compositions, sizes and chemical surface modifications on the rat alveolar macrophage cell line NR8383. The NMs were investigated at three doses ranging from 2.5 to 10 µg/cm2 after 24 h incubation using an integrated multi-omics approach involving untargeted proteomics, targeted metabolomics, and src homology 2 (SH2) profiling. By using Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) for the integrative data, we identified correlations of molecular pathways with physico-chemical properties and toxicological endpoints. The three investigated SiO2 variants induced strong alterations in all three omics approaches and were, therefore, be classified as “active.” Two organic phthalocyanines showed minor responses and Mn2O3 induced a different molecular response pattern than the other NMs. WGCNA revealed that agglomerate size and surface area as well as LDH release are among the most important parameters correlating with nanotoxicology. Moreover, we identified key drivers that can serve as representative biomarker candidates, supporting the value of multi-omics approaches to establish integrated approaches to testing and assessment (IATAs)."
Evaluation of interactive effects of UV light and nano encapsulation on the toxicity of azoxystrobin on zebrafish,"The use of nanotechnology to enhance pesticide formulations holds the promise of reduced pesticide use, reduced mobility in soils, and overall improvements in agricultural practices while simultaneously maintaining yields. However, the toxicity of nano-enabled pesticides, including azoxystrobin (Az), has not been well studied compared with their conventional form. This study investigates both lethal and sub-lethal endpoints in zebrafish embryos up to 120 h post-fertilization (hpf) under either laboratory light or simulated UV light. The median lethal concentration (LC50) value of nano-enabled Az (nAz) was significantly lower than the conventional form (Az). Interestingly, artificial UV light significantly increased toxicity (decreased LC50) of both Az and nAz. Malformations were not observed but the remaining yolk sac volume was significantly increased in both types of Az at both light conditions. This decreased yolk consumption is in agreement with reduced oxygen consumption and heart rate. Catalase enzyme activity was only reduced to UV light while superoxide dismutase activity was significantly reduced by co-exposure of UV light, and either type of Az at a nominal concentration of 100 μg L−1. The co-exposure of Az at 100 μg L−1 and UV light significantly upregulated sod1, sod2, and gpx1b expression and both types of Az significantly reduced gpx1a expression. Lipid peroxidation was significantly increased in nAz and Az at 100 μg L−1 under laboratory light, while UV light induced even higher level of lipid peroxidation. The results will provide important information on the toxicity of nAz under ecologically realistic conditions."
Cyclooxygenase-2 modulates ER-mitochondria crosstalk to mediate superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles induced hepatotoxicity: an in vitro and in vivo study,"Mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAMs) are central microdomains of the ER that interact with mitochondria. MAMs provide an essential platform for crosstalk between the ER and mitochondria and play a critical role in the local transfer of calcium (Ca2+) to maintain cellular functions. Despite the potential uses of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO-NPs) in biomedical applications, the hepatotoxicity of these nanoparticles (NPs) is not well characterized and little is known about the involvement of MAMs in ER-mitochondria crosstalk. We studied SPIO-NPs-associated hepatotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, human normal hepatic L02 cells were exposed to SPIO-NPs (2.5, 7.5, and 12.5 μg/mL) for 6 h and SPIO-NPs (12.5 μg/mL) was found to induce apoptosis. In vivo, SPIO-NPs induced liver injury when mice were intravenously injected with 20 mg/kg body weight SPIO-NPs for 24 h. Based on both in vitro and in vivo studies, we found that the structure and Ca2+ transport function of MAMs were perturbated and an accumulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in MAMs fractions was increased upon treatment of SPIO-NPs. The interaction between COX-2 and the components of MAMs, in terms of IP3R-GRP75-VDAC1 complex, was also revealed. Furthermore, the role of COX-2 in SPIO-NPs-associated hepatotoxicity was investigated by modifying the expression of COX-2. We demonstrated that COX-2 increases the structural and functional ER-mitochondria coupling and enhances the efficacy of ER-mitochondria Ca2+ transfer through the MAMs, thus sensitizing hepatocytes to a mitochondrial Ca2+ overload-dependent apoptosis. Taken together, our findings link SPIO-NPs-triggered hepatotoxicity with ER-mitochondria Ca2+ crosstalk which is mediated by COX-2 and provide mechanistic insight into the impact of interorganelle ER-mitochondria communication on hepatic nanotoxicity."
Defect-induced electronic states amplify the cellular toxicity of ZnO nanoparticles,"Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) are used in numerous applications, including sunscreens, cosmetics, textiles, and electrical devices. Increased consumer and occupational exposure to ZnO NPs potentially poses a risk for toxicity. While many studies have examined the toxicity of ZnO NPs, little is known regarding the toxicological impact of inherent defects arising from batch-to-batch variations. It was hypothesized that the presence of varying chemical defects in ZnO NPs will contribute to cellular toxicity in rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs). Pristine and defected ZnO NPs (oxidized, reduced, and annealed) were prepared and assessed three major cellular outcomes; cytotoxicity/apoptosis, reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. ZnO NPs chemical defects were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and photoluminescence. Increased toxicity was observed in defected ZnO NPs compared to the pristine NPs as measured by cell viability, ER stress, and glutathione redox potential. It was determined that ZnO NPs induced ER stress through the PERK pathway. Taken together, these results demonstrate a previously unrecognized contribution of chemical defects to the toxicity of ZnO NPs, which should be considered in the risk assessment of engineered nanomaterials."
"Modularly Designed Peptide Nanoprodrug Augments Antitumor Immunity of PD-L1 Checkpoint Blockade by Targeting Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase","The limited efficacy of single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors in treating tumors has prompted investigations on their combination partners. Here, a tumor-homing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) nanoinhibitor is reported to selectively inhibit immunosuppressive IDO pathway in the tumor microenvironment. It is self-assembled from a modularly designed peptide-drug conjugate containing a hydrophilic targeting motif (arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid; RGD), two protonatable histidines, and an ester bond-linked hydrophobic IDO inhibitor, which exhibits pH-responsive disassembly and esterase-catalyzed drug release. Markedly, it achieved potent and persistent inhibition of intratumoral IDO activity with a reduced systemic toxicity, which greatly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of programmed cell death-ligand 1 blockade in vivo. Overall, this study provides a promising paradigm of combinatorial normalization immunotherapy by exploiting a targeted IDO nanoinhibitor to augment the antitumor immunity of checkpoint inhibitors."
Genotoxicity of silver nanoparticles,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used in diverse sectors such as medicine, food, cosmetics, household items, textiles and electronics. Given the extent of human exposure to AgNPs, information about the toxicological effects of such products is required to ensure their safety. For this reason, we performed a bibliographic review of the genotoxicity studies carried out with AgNPs over the last six years. A total of 43 articles that used well-established standard assays (i.e., in vitro mouse lymphoma assays, in vitro micronucleus tests, in vitro comet assays, in vivo micronucleus tests, in vivo chromosome aberration tests and in vivo comet assays), were selected. The results showed that AgNPs produce genotoxic effects at all DNA damage levels evaluated, in both in vitro and in vivo assays. However, a higher proportion of positive results was obtained in the in vitro studies. Some authors observed that coating and size had an effect on both in vitro and in vivo results. None of the studies included a complete battery of assays, as recommended by ICH and EFSA guidelines, and few of the authors followed OECD guidelines when performing assays. A complete genotoxicological characterization of AgNPs is required for decision-making."
Titanium Incorporation into Zr-Porphyrinic Metal–Organic Frameworks with Enhanced Antibacterial Activity against Multidrug-Resistant Pathogens,"This study uses metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) alone without any added antibacterial ingredients as the nonantibiotic agent for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of chronic wounds infected by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. Nanoparticles (NPs) of MOFs (PCN-224) are incorporated with titanium through a facile cation exchange strategy. The obtained bimetallic PCN-224(Zr/Ti) shows greatly enhanced photocatalytic performance for the generation of reactive oxygen species under visible light, which is responsible for the effective antibacterial activities. The PCN-224(Zr/Ti) NPs are loaded onto lactic-co-glycolic acid nanofibers to prepare a wound dressing, which shows high biocompatibility and minimal cytotoxicity. The wound dressing is efficient for PDT-based in vivo healing of the chronic wound infected by MDR bacteria. Most importantly, this work does not involve any additional antibacterial agents, which is facile, low cost, and in particular, greatly explores the potential of MOFs as a powerful nonantibiotic agent in PDT."
Transformable peptide nanoparticles arrest HER2 signalling and cause cancer cell death in vivo,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed in >20% of breast cancers. Dimerization of HER2 receptors leads to the activation of downstream signals enabling the proliferation and survival of malignant phenotypes. Owing to the high expression levels of HER2, combination therapies are currently required for the treatment of HER2+ breast cancer. Here, we designed non-toxic transformable peptides that self-assemble into micelles under aqueous conditions but, on binding to HER2 on cancer cells, transform into nanofibrils that disrupt HER2 dimerization and subsequent downstream signalling events leading to apoptosis of cancer cells. The phase transformation of peptides enables specific HER2 targeting, and inhibition of HER2 dimerization blocks the expression of proliferation and survival genes in the nucleus. We demonstrate, in mouse xenofraft models, that these transformable peptides can be used as a monotherapy in the treatment of HER2+ breast cancer."
Toward Rigorous Materials Production: New Approach Methodologies Have Extensive Potential to Improve Current Safety Assessment Practices,"Advanced material development, including at the nanoscale, comprises costly and complex challenges coupled to ensuring human and environmental safety. Governmental agencies regulating safety have announced interest toward acceptance of safety data generated under the collective term New Approach Methodologies (NAMs), as such technologies/approaches offer marked potential to progress the integration of safety testing measures during innovation from idea to product launch of nanomaterials. Divided in overall eight main categories, searchable databases for grouping and read across purposes, exposure assessment and modeling, in silico modeling of physicochemical structure and hazard data, in vitro high-throughput and high-content screening assays, dose-response assessments and modeling, analyses of biological processes and toxicity pathways, kinetics and dose extrapolation, consideration of relevant exposure levels and biomarker endpoints typify such useful NAMs. Their application generally agrees with articulated stakeholder needs for improvement of safety testing procedures. They further fit for inclusion and add value in nanomaterials risk assessment tools. Overall 37 of 50 evaluated NAMs and tiered workflows applying NAMs are recommended for considering safer-by-design innovation, including guidance to the selection of specific NAMs in the eight categories. An innovation funnel enriched with safety methods is ultimately proposed under the central aim of promoting rigorous nanomaterials innovation."
Colorimetric determination of ascorbic acid using a polyallylamine-stabilized IrO<inf>2</inf>/graphene oxide nanozyme as a peroxidase mimic,"The authors describe a peroxidase-mimicking nanozyme composed of IrO2 and graphene oxide (GO). It was synthesized from monodisperse IrO2 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 1.7 ± 0.3 nm that were prepared by pulsed laser ablation in ethanol. The nanoparticles were then placed on polyallylamine-modified GO nanosheets through electrostatic interaction. The peroxidase-like activity of the resulting nanocomposites was evaluated by catalytic oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine in the presence of H2O2. Kinetic results demonstrated that the catalytic behavior of the nanocomposites follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Experiments performed with terephthalic acid and cytochrome C confirmed that the peroxidase-like activity originated from the electron transfer mechanism rather than from generation of hydroxy radicals. The peroxidase-like activity is inhibited in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA). Based on this property, a colorimetric assay was developed for the determination of AA by exploiting the peroxidase-like activity of IrO2/GO nanocomposites. The linear relationship between absorbance at 652 nm and the concentration of AA was acquired. The limit of detection for AA is 324 nM. Further applications of the method for AA detection in real samples were also successfully demonstrated. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
Emerging nanomedicines for anti-stromal therapy against desmoplastic tumors,"Solid tumors, especially desmoplastic tumors, are characterized by a dense fibrotic stroma composed of abundant cancer-associated fibroblasts and excessive extracellular matrix. These physical barriers seriously compromise drug delivery to tumor cells, leading to suboptimal treatment efficacy and resistance to current tumor-centric therapeutics. The need to overcome these problems has driven extensive investigations and sparked the flourish of anti-stromal therapy, particularly in the field of nanomedicines. In this paper, we firstly review the major components of the tumor stroma and discuss their impact on drug delivery. Then, according to the different stromal targets, we summarize the current status of anti-stromal therapy and highlight recent advances in anti-stromal nanomedicines. We further examine the potential of nano-enabled anti-stromal therapy to enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of other therapeutic modalities, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, phototherapy and radiotherapy. Finally, the potential concerns and future developments of anti-stromal nanomedicines are discussed."
Effect of fullerenol nanoparticles on oxidative stress induced by paraquat in honey bees,"The enormous progress in nanomaterials development and their use, followed by their inevitable environmental print, has arisen the emerging questions concerning their influence to the living systems. Honey bees are considered to be quite a suitable model system for the risk assessment and prediction of various external influences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dealing with the influence of fullerenol nanoparticles (FNP), a biodegradable carbon nanomaterials’ representative, to honey bees. This investigation was conducted with an aim to merge two different open-ended questions: the potential toxic effect of FNP to the bees on the one hand and antioxidative effect of FNP on the other hand. Since FNP antioxidative properties were proved in a number of in vivo models, we hypothesized the similar outcomes, and according to this assumption, we opted for paraquat as a well-known oxidative stress inducer. FNP did not have toxic effect in none of investigated concentrations. The results also confirmed the potential of FNP to reduce oxidative stress through the gene expression of antioxidative enzymes and the change in the redox state of the cells. Additional experiments are needed for a better understanding of the exact mechanism and complex patterns of FNP’s activity."
Biomimetic carbon nanotubes for neurological disease therapeutics as inherent medication,"Nowadays, nanotechnology is revolutionizing the approaches to different fields from manufacture to health. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as promising candidates in nanomedicine have great potentials in developing novel entities for central nervous system pathologies, due to their excellent physicochemical properties and ability to interface with neurons and neuronal circuits. However, most of the studies mainly focused on the drug delivery and bioimaging applications of CNTs, while neglect their application prospects as therapeutic drugs themselves. At present, the relevant reviews are not available yet. Herein we summarized the latest advances on the biomedical and therapeutic applications of CNTs in vitro and in vivo for neurological diseases treatments as inherent therapeutic drugs. The biological mechanisms of CNTs-mediated bio-medical effects and potential toxicity of CNTs were also intensely discussed. It is expected that CNTs will exploit further neurological applications on disease therapy in the near future."
Co-localized delivery of nanomedicine and nanovaccine augments the postoperative cancer immunotherapy by amplifying T-cell responses,"Immunotherapy in solid tumors is limited by the poor immunogenicity of tumors and limited T-cell immune response, resulting in low patient response rate. To increase the efficiency of cancer immunotherapy, a unique synergistic combination cancer immunotherapy by co-localized delivery of cancer nanomedicine for enhancing the tumor immunogenicity and nanovaccine for augmenting the antitumor T-cell immunity was developed for post-surgical tumor treatment. The thermo-responsive, curcumin-loaded polymer nanoparticles (nanomedicine)-assembled hydrogel enabled the complete coverage of the surgical bed of primary tumor and the spatio-temporal delivery of cognate nanomedicines and encapsulated nanovaccines. Importantly, the nanomedicine efficiently induced the immunogenic cell death (ICD) of residual cancer cells, and consequently enhanced the tumor immunogenicity and sensitized the tumor to antitumor T-cell immunity. The cancer nanovaccine composed of antigenic peptide, CpG-ODN and cationic polymer nanoparticle significantly triggered the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and elicited potent vaccine-specific T-cell immune responses. Using highly malignant postoperative breast carcinoma 4T1 models, we found that the combination immunotherapy strategy strikingly amplified the level of systemic host T-cell immunity, promoted the infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes in tumor, and thus efficaciously attenuated the local tumor recurrence and pulmonary metastasis. Collectively, this work provided an advanced synergistic combination approach for post-surgical tumor immunotherapy. The self-assembled hydrogel should enable a broader combination of immunomodulating nanomedicines and vaccines for cancer immunotherapy."
"A comparative study on the accumulation, translocation and transformation of selenite, selenate, and SeNPs in a hydroponic-plant system","Plants can play important roles in overcoming selenium (Se) deficiency and Se toxicity in various regions of the world. Selenite (SeIV), selenate (SeVI), as well as Se nanoparticles (SeNPs) naturally formed through reduction of SeIV, are the three main Se species in the environment. The bioaccumulation and transformation of these Se species in plants still need more understanding. The aims of this study are to investigate the phytotoxicity, accumulation, and transformation of SeIV, SeVI and SeNPs in garlic, a relatively Se accumulative plant. The spatial distribution of Se in the roots were imaged using synchrotron radiation micro-focused X-ray fluorescence (SR-μXRF). The chemical forms of Se in different plant tissues were analyzed using synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (SR-XAS). The results demonstrate that 1) SeNPs which has the lowest phytotoxicity is stable in water, but prone to be converted to organic Se species, such as C–Se–C (MeSeCys) upon uptake by root. 2) SeIV is prone to concentrate in the root and incorporated into C–Se–C (MeSeCys) and C–Se-R (SeCys) bonding forms; 3) SeVI with the lowest transformation probability to organic Se species has the highest phytotoxicity to plant, and is much easier to translocate from root to leaf than SeNPs and SeIV. The present work provides insights into potential impact of SeNPs, selenite and selenate on aquatic-plant ecosystems, and is beneficial for systematically understanding the Se accumulation and transformation in food chain."
Degradation-regulated architecture of injectable smart hydrogels enhances humoral immune response and potentiates antitumor activity in human lung carcinoma,"Cancer vaccines that elicit a robust and durable antitumor response show great promise in cancer immunotherapy. Nevertheless, low immunogenicity and weak immune response limit the application of cancer vaccines. To experience next generation cancer vaccines that elicit robust, durable, and anti-tumor T cell response, herein we design injectable smart hydrogels (ISHs) that self-assemble into a cellular microenvironment-like microporous network using a simple hypodermic needle injection, to localize the immune cells and program host cells. ISHs, composed of levodopa- and poly(ε-caprolactone-co-lactide)ester-functionalized hyaluronic acid (HA-PCLA), are loaded with immunomodulatory factor (OVA expressing plasmid, pOVA)-bearing nano-sized polyplexes and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as dendritic cell (DC) enhancement factor. Subcutaneous administration of ISHs effectively localized immune cells, and controlled the delivery of immunomodulatory factors to recruit immune cells. The microporous network allowed the recruitment of a substantial number of DCs, which was 6-fold higher than conventional PCLA counterpart. The locally released nano-sized polyplexes effectively internalized to DCs, resulting in the presentation of tumor-specific OVA epitope, and subsequent activation of CD4+ T cells and generation of OVA-specific serum antibody. By the controlled release of nano-sized polyplexes and GM-CSF through a single subcutaneous injection, the ISHs effectively eliminated B16/OVA melanoma tumors in mice. These ISHs can be administered using a minimal invasive technique that could bypass the need for extracorporeal training of cells ex vivo, and provide sustained release of cancer vaccines for immunomodulation. These important findings suggest that ISHs can serve as powerful biomaterials for cancer immunotherapy."

Comparative study of the effects of different chelating ligands on the absorption and transport of mercury in maize (Zea mays L.),"Mercury (Hg) pollution seriously threatens food safety and has attracted global attention. Phytoextraction, due to its low cost, applicability, and environmental friendliness, is considered a new technology for clean-up of heavy metal contamination in the environment. However, the low bioavailability of Hg in polluted areas greatly limits the applicability of phytoextraction. Here, we compared the effects of six common chelating ligands on the absorption and transport of Hg in maize (Zea mays L.), which has a high biomass and short growth cycle. The results showed that the root length and biomass of maize seedlings of the groups treated with the six chelating ligands (EDTA, iodide, ammonium, thiosulfate, thiocyanate, and thiocarbamide) did not change compared with those of the non-treated groups. Co-exposure to Hg and each chelating ligand markedly alleviated the inhibitory effect induced by Hg. Iodide treatment resulted in the lowest root Hg content and highest translocation factor (TF) value, while ammonium treatment gave rise to the highest shoot Hg concentration and lowest TF. Compared with other chelating ligands, thiosulfate exhibited the maximum alleviation of Hg toxicity and achieved the highest concentration of Hg in the roots and aerial parts. Moreover, the TF and Hg accumulation in the thiosulfate and Hg co-exposed group were much higher than those in the group exposed to Hg alone. This finding suggests that, among these common chelating ligands, thiosulfate compounds have great potential for Hg phytoextraction, while the others can immobilize Hg in polluted areas."
Graphene Oxide Causes Disordered Zonation Due to Differential Intralobular Localization in the Liver,"The liver is the primary organ to sequester nanodrugs, representing a substantial hurdle for drug delivery and raising toxicity concerns. However, the mechanistic details underlying the liver sequestration and effects on the liver are still elusive. The difficulty in studying the liver lies in its complexity, which is structured with stringently organized anatomical units called lobules. Graphene oxide (GO) has attracted attention for its applications in biomedicine, especially as a nanocarrier; however, its sequestration and effects in the liver, the major enrichment and metabolic organ, are less understood. Herein, we unveiled the differential distribution of GO in lobules in the liver, with a higher amount surrounding portal triad zones than the central vein zones. Strikingly, liver zonation patterns also changed, as reflected by changes in vital zonated genes involved in hepatocyte integrity and metabolism, leading to compromised hepatic functions. RNA-Seq and DNA methylation sequencing analyses unraveled that GO-induced changes in liver functional zonation could be ascribed to dysregulation of key signaling pathways governing liver zonation at not only mRNA transcriptions but also DNA methylation imprinting patterns, partially through TET-dependent signaling. Together, this study reveals the differential GO distribution pattern in liver lobules and pinpoints the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in GO-induced liver zonation alterations."
A Near-Infrared Peptide Probe with Tumor-Specific Excretion-Retarded Effect for Image-Guided Surgery of Renal Cell Carcinoma,"Image-guided surgery plays a crucial role in realizing complete tumor removal, reducing postoperative recurrence and increasing patient survival. However, imaging of tumor lesion in the typical metabolic organs, e.g., kidney and liver, still has great challenges due to the intrinsic nonspecific accumulation of imaging probes in those organs. Herein, we report an in situ self-assembled near-infrared (NIR) peptide probe with tumor-specific excretion-retarded (TER) effect in tumor lesions, enabling high-performance imaging of human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and achieving complete tumor removal, ultimately reducing postoperative recurrence. The NIR peptide probe first specifically recognizes αvβ3 integrin overexpressed in renal cancer cells, then is cleaved by MMP-2/9, which is up-regulated in the tumor microenvironment. The probe residue spontaneously self-assembles into nanofibers that exhibit an excretion-retarded effect in the kidney, which contributes to a high signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio in orthotopic RCC mice. Intriguingly, the TER effect also enables precisely identifying eye-invisible tiny lesions (<1 mm), which contributes to complete tumor removal and significantly reduces the postoperative recurrence compared with traditional surgery. Finally, the TER strategy is successfully employed in high-performance identification of human RCC in an ex vivo kidney perfusion model. Taken together, this NIR peptide probe based on the TER strategy is a promising method for detecting tumors in metabolic organs in diverse biomedical applications."
Application of dissolvable Mg/Al layered double hydroxides as an adsorbent for the dispersive solid phase extraction of gold nanoparticles prior to their determination by atomic absorption spectrometry,"In this work, dissolvable layered double hydroxides (LDH) were used for the first time for the extraction and preconcentration of metallic nanoparticles from water samples. Magnesium-aluminum LDHs were prepared in situ in a sample solution by alkaline co-precipitation and separated by centrifugation. It was found that gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and gold ions could be simultaneously extracted by the LDH by electrostatic interactions and anion exchange reactions, respectively. Separation of AuNPs from gold ions could be achieved by ultracentrifugation enabling the selective determination of AuNPs in the sample. Two analytical techniques based on molecular and atomic spectrometry (spectrophotometry and electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry) were used to optimize the method and determine the concentration of AuNPs in spiked environmental water samples at femtomolar concentration levels, respectively. Under the optimized experimental conditions the method enables the determination and speciation of AuNPs at concentration levels as low as 16 femtomole L-1 with satisfactory recoveries (71-91%) and good reproducibility (<9%)."
Metallic Fingerprints of Carbon: Label-Free Tracking and Imaging of Graphene in Plants,"Detection and quantification of carbon nanomaterials are extremely challenging, especially under the background interference of carbon. Here, we propose a new label-free method to quantify, track, and in situ image graphene and graphene oxide (GO) in plants based on their inherent metallic impurities as fingerprints. We show the ubiquity and high stability of inherent metallic fingerprints of graphene and GO obtained from different exposure routes under the natural environments, which enables the materials to be easily quantified and in situ imaged by high-sensitivity (laser ablation) inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The method was applied to investigate the uptake and spatial distribution of graphene and GO in soybean plants. The plants were cultivated in graphene or GO solutions for 7 days, and the indicative elements (Ni or Mn) in different parts of plants were monitored and imaged. We found that graphene and GO showed different distribution patterns in plants (the highest uptake percentages in root up to 14.4% for graphene and 47.8% for GO), and high concentration of material exposure might cause excessive accumulation of materials in roots which blocked their further transport to the other parts of plants. The present method is more straightforward, accessible, and economical than normally used isotopic or metal-labeling methods. It also avoids the uncertainties or alterations of properties caused by the labeling process and thus has great promise in analysis and risk assessment of carbon nanomaterials."
Inherently PET/CT Dual Modality Imaging Lipid Nanocapsules for Early Detection of Orthotopic Lung Tumors,"Accurate diagnosis of cancer at an early stage is the key to reduce cancer mortality and improve survival. PET imaging has high sensitivity but low spatial resolution, while CT imaging has good spatial location information. Therefore, the combination of PET and CT imaging can provide complementary advantages to achieve accurate early diagnosis of tumors. However, currently developed PET or CT imaging agents have only a single function. Here, we designed and constructed a self-assembled lipid nanocapsule encapsulated with iodixanol and labeled with self-chelated 64Cu for precise PET/CT imaging of tiny lung tumor. The lipid nanocapsule self-assembled in water using LPPC-Ce6, a conjugate of chlorin e6 (Ce6) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPPC), to form a bilayer vesicular structure. 64Cu was embedded in the center of the tetrapyrrole ring of Ce6 by natural capture ability for Cu2+ ions. GLT21.T, the aptamer targeting lung cancer, was conjugated to the surface of the lipid nanocapsules. Iodixanol was loaded into the cavity of the lipid nanocapsule (64Cu@LCI-apt). In the nanostructure, the loading of iodixanol was sufficiently high, and the specific activity could be flexibly adjusted according to imaging requirements. The prepared 64Cu@LCI-apt achieves excellent radiolabeling efficiency, stability and effective targeting of lung tumor. In an early orthotopic lung cancer model, 64Cu@LCI-apt demonstrated the capabilities of sensitive PET imaging and enhanced contrast CT imaging to enable efficient high-quality PTE/CT imaging of tiny orthotopic lung tumor with a diameter of 500 μm. 64Cu@LCI-apt has great potential for early, sensitive, and accurate diagnosis of tumors through dual-mode PET/CT imaging."
Bioprotective properties of nano-diamond composition at intragastric introduction to rats,"We studied a biocompatibility and a bioprotector property of nanodiamond composites on reduction of the toxic action to cadmium salt. The experimental animal intragastric received with the help of a probe activated carbon and nanodiamond composite. We researched the rate of spontaneous and ascorbate-dependent lipids peroxidation and the reference level of malonic dialdehyde in liver, thyroid and adrenal glands tissues. So this concentration of the nanopore material at intragastric entering did not led to difference of researched parameters of the lipid peroxidation. The solution of cadmium salt developed typical for it toxic action which expressed in increase intensity of the processes of POL in liver and thyroid gland tissues. The nanopore material developed the characteristic which screened the toxic action of cadmium chloride and it was more denominated on some parameters in comparison with the effect of the intragastric entering of the activated carbon."
Nanotoxicity: The impact of increasing drug bioavailability. the impact of increasing drug bioavailability.,"Nanotechnology is currently one of the greatest revolutions in biomedicine, because it has the ability to increase the biological activity of new drugs, as well as to renew the therapeutic action of old or discarded compounds. All this is thanks to the potential to change the chemical structure of the molecules with which they are integrated into various nanoformulations. Likewise, nanotechnological tools promise to be used as instruments in nanotheranostics to develop methods of diagnosis and simultaneous treatment, which will lead to a high exposure to nanomaterials and nanostructures, which warns about the possible risks and toxicities that may arise from the massive use of nanotechnology. Therefore, the objective of this chapter is to give key concepts for the evaluation of the toxicity of nanotechnological products that will be useful for the design of a road map with which to select compounds with greater activity and low risk."
Corona of Thorns: The Surface Chemistry-Mediated Protein Corona Perturbs the Recognition and Immune Response of Macrophages,"The significance of protein coronas on the biological fates of nanoparticles has been widely recognized. Therefore, the alterations on biological effects caused by protein coronas need systemic study and interpretation to design novel safe and efficient nanomedicines. In the present study, we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the protein coronas on gold nanorods modified with various surface ligands of different chemical compositions and charges. The design of surface ligands is of utmost importance for the functionalization of nanoparticles, and further, the ligand-induced biological identity determines the fate of nanoparticles in the human body. We found that the surface chemistry influences the composition of the protein corona more profoundly than surface charge. Since the first and most important challenge for administrated nanomedicines is navigating the interaction with macrophages, we further investigated how the surface chemistry-induced specific protein corona affects the phagocytosis and immune responses of macrophages exposed to the corona-nanoparticle complexes. Our results reveal that the protein corona alters the internalization pathways of gold nanorods by macrophages via the interactions of the predominant coronal proteins with specific receptors on the cell membrane. The cytokine secretion profile of macrophages is also highly dependent on the adsorption pattern of the protein corona. The more abundant proteins involved in immune responses, such as acute phase, complement, and tissue leakage proteins, present in the acquired nanoparticle corona, the more macrophage interleukin-1β (IL-1β) released is stimulated. The ligand-protein corona composition-immune response coefficient analysis may serve next-generation nanomedicines with high efficiency and good safety for better clinical translation."
Broadband Dielectric Metalens for Polarization Manipulating and Superoscillation Focusing of Visible Light,"Superoscillatory optical devices have been widely investigated in the past several years. Due to their unique focusing properties, the ones that focus cylindrically polarized waves are attractive for such applications as super-resolution imaging and particle manipulation. However, the superoscillatory lenses reported for the focusing of cylindrically polarized light suffer from difficulties related to precise coaxial alignment, which might lead to the substantial distortions of the superoscillatory features. Moreover, conventional polarization converters only have a narrow bandwidth of several tens of nanometers in the visible spectrum, which limits the broadband focusing of cylindrically polarized waves. In this work, an amorphous silicon dielectric meta-atom is proposed with the integrated functions of independent polarization conversion and binary phase modulation in the visible spectrum range. Based on the proposed meta-atom, a superoscillatory dielectric metalens with a high numerical aperture (NA) of 0.93 is proposed and optimized for the broadband generating and superoscillation focusing of azimuthally polarized lights. The linearly polarized wave was first converted into azimuthally polarized ones, and then focused into a superoscillation hollow spot of azimuthal polarization (AP). The experimental results demonstrate the formation of hollow spots with inner sizes of 0.355λ-0.490λ in the wavelength range of 518.1-683.5 nm. This simple approach paves an alternative pathway of generating vector waves with superoscillation features for super-resolution applications."
Lipopolysaccharide induces neuroinflammation in microglia by activating the MTOR pathway and downregulating Vps34 to inhibit autophagosome formation,"Background: Microglial activation is a prominent feature of neuroinflammation, which is present in almost all neurodegenerative diseases. While an initial inflammatory response mediated by microglia is considered to be protective, excessive pro-inflammatory response of microglia contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. Although autophagy is involved in the suppression of inflammation, its role and mechanism in microglia are unclear. Methods: In the present study, we studied the mechanism by which lipopolysaccharide (LPS) affects microglial autophagy and the effects of autophagy on the production of pro-inflammatory factors in microglial cells by western blotting, immunocytochemistry, transfection, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and real-time PCR. In a mouse model of neuroinflammation, generated by intraventricular injection of LPS (5 μg/animal), we induced autophagy by rapamycin injection and investigated the effects of enhanced autophagy on microglial activation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry. Results: We found that autophagic flux was suppressed in LPS-stimulated N9 microglial cells, as evidenced by decreased expression of the autophagy marker LC3-II (lipidated form of MAP1LC3), as well as increased levels of the autophagy adaptor protein SQSTM1. LPS significantly decreased Vps34 expression in N9 microglial cells by activating the PI3KI/AKT/MTOR pathway without affecting the levels of lysosome-associated proteins and enzymes. More importantly, overexpression of Vps34 significantly enhanced the autophagic flux and decreased the accumulation of SQSTM1 in LPS-stimulated N9 microglial cells. Moreover, our results revealed that an LPS-induced reduction in the level of Vps34 prevented the maturation of omegasomes to phagophores. Furthermore, LPS-induced neuroinflammation was significantly ameliorated by treatment with the autophagy inducer rapamycin both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions: These data reveal that LPS-induced neuroinflammation in N9 microglial cells is associated with the inhibition of autophagic flux through the activation of the PI3KI/AKT/MTOR pathway, while enhanced microglial autophagy downregulates LPS-induced neuroinflammation. Thus, this study suggests that promoting the early stages of autophagy might be a potential therapeutic approach for neuroinflammation-associated diseases."
"Dye-doped silica nanoparticles: Synthesis, surface chemistry and bioapplications","Background: Fluorescent silica nanoparticles have been extensively utilised in a broad range of biological applications and are facilitated by their predictable, well-understood, flexible chemistry and apparent biocompatibility. The ability to couple various siloxane precursors with fluorescent dyes and to be subsequently incorporated into silica nanoparticles has made it possible to engineer these fluorophores-doped nanomaterials to specific optical requirements in biological experimentation. Consequently, this class of nanomaterial has been used in applications across immunodiagnostics, drug delivery and human-trial bioimaging in cancer research. Main body: This review summarises the state-of-the-art of the use of dye-doped silica nanoparticles in bioapplications and firstly accounts for the common nanoparticle synthesis methods, surface modification approaches and different bioconjugation strategies employed to generate biomolecule-coated nanoparticles. The use of dye-doped silica nanoparticles in immunoassays/biosensing, bioimaging and drug delivery is then provided and possible future directions in the field are highlighted. Other non-cancer-related applications involving silica nanoparticles are also briefly discussed. Importantly, the impact of how the protein corona has changed our understanding of NP interactions with biological systems is described, as well as demonstrations of its capacity to be favourably manipulated. Conclusions: Dye-doped silica nanoparticles have found success in the immunodiagnostics domain and have also shown promise as bioimaging agents in human clinical trials. Their use in cancer delivery has been restricted to murine models, as has been the case for the vast majority of nanomaterials intended for cancer therapy. This is hampered by the need for more human-like disease models and the lack of standardisation towards assessing nanoparticle toxicity. However, developments in the manipulation of the protein corona have improved the understanding of fundamental bio-nano interactions, and will undoubtedly assist in the translation of silica nanoparticles for disease treatment to the clinic."
Single-particle analysis for structure and iron chemistry of atmospheric particulate matter,"As a representative transition metal, iron plays a key role in chemical activities of atmospheric particulate matter (PM), being involved in particle-related free radical generation and adverse health effects. However, limited understanding of the structure and properties of individual micrometer-sized particulates obscures investigating the contributions of iron toward chemical activities. Here, we describe multidimensional analytical strategies to characterize the mass, spatial distribution, and chemical forms of iron in single haze particles using synchrotron radiation techniques. We first used X-ray fluorescence imaging to quantify the masses of multiple metals and yielded distribution maps of transition metals, which revealed the types of elements that tend to occur together. Additionally, we employed nanocomputed tomography to assess the spatial distribution of iron and observed that iron exists as small aggregates and is concentrated primarily in subsurface regions. We also combined X-ray absorption near structures with scanning transmission X-ray microscopy to quantify the ferrous and ferric forms and mapped their distributions in individual particles, which probably attribute chemical activity of iron. In conclusion, we demonstrated the power of synchrotron radiation-based techniques to study heretofore inaccessible chemical information in single haze particles, which may provide important clues about iron chemistry as a source of Fenton reactions and health effects. The multifaceted analytical approaches exhibit high sensitivity (subfemtogram per particle or ∼0.2 fg/μm2) toward multiple elements and are promising to be used for studying other concepts such as the solubility of aerosol iron, the heterogeneous oxidation of organic matters and SO2, and the formation and the aging of haze particles."
Metabonomic Investigation of Biological Effects of a New Vessel Target Protein tTF-pHLIP in a Mouse Model,"In recent years, tumor microenvironment (TME) has been recognized as potential targets for tumor treatment and the tumor vascular system is one of such targets. Fusing truncated tissue factor (tTF) with pH low insertion peptides (pHLIP), tTF-pHLIP, can target tumor vessels owing to its acidic TME and cause tumor vessel occlusion by blood clotting and subsequently effectively inhibit tumor growth. To evaluate its bioeffects, we exposed the tTF-pHLIP to normal mice and mice xenograft with B16F10 tumor and analyzed the metabolic profiling of various tissues and biofluids including plasma and urine from mice treated with and without tTF-pHLIP. A combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was employed in the study. We found that tTF-pHLIP treatment can effectively reduce tumor size and concurrently ameliorate tumor-induced alterations in the TCA cycle metabolism and lipid metabolism. In addition, we found that toxicity of tTF-pHLIP to normal mice is minor and exposure of the tTF-pHLIP induced oxidative stress to the system. Hence, we concluded that tTF-pHLIP is of low toxicity and effective in reducing tumor size as well as rebalancing tumor-induced metabolic derailment."
Multi-walled carbon nanotubes activate and shift polarization of pulmonary macrophages and dendritic cells in an in vivo model of chronic obstructive lung disease,"With substantial progress of nanotechnology, there is rising concern about possible adverse health effects related to inhalation of nanomaterials, such as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). In particular, individuals with chronic respiratory disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), may potentially be more susceptible to adverse health effects related to inhaled MWCNT. Hazard assessment of such inhaled nanomaterials therefore requires timely clarification. This was assessed in this study using a mouse model of COPD by exposing animals to 0.08 µg/cm2 of MWCNT administered by intratracheal instillation. Treatment with MWCNT induced an accumulation of alveolar macrophages (AMφ) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in COPD mice that increased from 24 h to 7 d. In COPD mice, MWCNT induced a dynamic shift in macrophage polarization as measured by expression of CD38 and CD206, and increased AMφ and lung parenchyma macrophage (LPMΦ) activation with upregulation of co-stimulatory markers CD40 and CD80. Moreover, MWCNT treatment increased the frequencies of pulmonary dendritic cells (DC), leading to an expansion of the CD11b+CD103− DC subset. Although MWCNT did not trigger lung functional or structural changes, they induced an increased expression of the muc5AC transcript in mice with COPD. Our data provide initial evidence that inhaled MWCNT affect the pulmonary mucosal immune system by altering the numbers, phenotype, and activation status of antigen-presenting cell populations. Extrapolating these in vivo mouse findings to human pulmonary MWCNT exposure, caution is warranted in limiting exposure when handling inhalable nanofibers."
Toxicological assessment of nanoparticle interactions with the pulmonary system,"Nanoparticle(NP)-based materials have breakthrough applications in many fields of life, such as in engineering, communications and textiles industries; food and bioenvironmental applications; medicines and cosmetics, etc. Biomedical applications of NPs are very active areas of research with successful translation to pharmaceutical and clinical uses overcoming both pharmaceutical and clinical challenges. Although the attractiveness and enhanced applications of these NPs stem from their exceptional properties at the nanoscale size, i.e. 1–1000 nm, they exhibit completely different physicochemical profiles and, subsequently, toxicological profiles from their parent bulk materials. Hence, the clinical evaluation and toxicological assessment of NPs interactions within biological systems are continuously evolving to ensure their safety at the nanoscale. The pulmonary system is one of the primary routes of exposure to airborne NPs either intentionally, via aerosolized nanomedicines targeting pulmonary pathologies such as cancer or asthma, or unintentionally, via natural NPs and anthropogenic (man-made) NPs. This review presents the state-of-the-art, contemporary challenges, and knowledge gaps in the toxicological assessment of NPs interactions with the pulmonary system. It highlights the main mechanisms of NP toxicity, factors influencing their toxicity, the different toxicological assessment methods and their drawbacks, and the recent NP regulatory guidelines based on literature collected from the research pool of NPs interactions with lung cell lines, in vivo inhalation studies, and clinical trials."
In vitro evaluation of magnetite nanoparticles in human mesenchymal stem cells: comparison of different cytotoxicity assays,"This work was aimed at defining the suitable test for evaluating Fe3O4 NPs cytotoxicity after short-term exposure in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) using different viability tests, namely NRU, MTT and TB assays, paralleled by cell morphology analyses for cross checking. MTT and NRU data (culture medium with/without hMSCs plus Fe3O4NPs) indicated artificial/false increments in cell viability after Fe3O4NPs. These observations did not fit with the morphological analyses showing reduced cell density, loss of monolayer features, and morphological alterations at Fe3O4NPs ≥50 μg/ml. Fe3O4NPs alone induced a substantial increased absorbance at the wavelength required for MTT and NRU. A significant death (25%) of hMSC at Fe3O4NPs ≥10 μg/ml, with a maximum effect (45%) at 300 μg/ml after 24 h, exacerbated after 48 h, was observed when applying TB test. These results paralleled the effects on cell morphology. The optical properties and stability of Fe3O4NP suspension (tendency to agglomerate in a specific culture medium) represent factors that limit in vitro result interpretation. These findings suggest the non applicability of the spectrophotometric assays for hMSC culture conditions, while TB is an accurate method for determining cell viability after Fe3O4NP exposure in this model. In relation to NPs safety assessment: cell-based assays must be considered on case-by-case basis; selection of relevant cell models is also important for predictive toxicological studies; application of a testing strategy is fundamental for understanding the toxicity pathways driving cellular responses."
Develpment of innovative biocidal nanoparticles for use in plastics technology,"Increased demands on high-end materials focus the development on new functionalities such as biocidal effects, which are made possible by property changes in the nanoscale range of existing materials or by a combination of different material classes. Therefore, nanoparticles based on transition metal oxides have been synthesized in order to reach biocidal properties on plastic part surfaces. The influence of the nanoparticles on the thermal and mechanical properties has been characterized as well as the biocidal properties of the plastic part surfaces and of the nanoparticles itself."
Advanced Nanomaterials in the Clinical Scenario: Virtues and Consequences,"Nanotechnology is the recently developed scientific discipline that copes with the application of nanoscience with the engineering of functional systems at the molecular extent. In the past era, the nanomaterials, “the basic units of nanotechnology,” were considered as the passive nanoscale particle structures or materials designed to perform only one task. Currently, nanotechnology is considered a broad and interdisciplinary area of advanced scientific research, which has a high impact on different fields of science, including biomedical research. Throughout the years of research, these nanomaterials are transformed into advanced nanomaterials or multifunctional nanoparticles (in medicine) which have different properties enabling those as multitasking nanoscale materials. For example, in the current scenario, the technologies developed for advanced nanomaterials are considered to have the potential for transfiguring how biomaterials are synthesized, functionalized, and utilized in different biomedical and medical applications such as actuators, drug delivery biomaterials, and biosensors. Even though these advanced nanomaterials are already having a significant commercial impact in the biomedical field, which is increasing day by day, it has its pros and cons, taking into account different issues or ideas which are discussed in this chapter in detail."

"Comparation of Anti-Inflammatory and Antioxidantactivities of Curcumin, Tetrahydrocurcuminand Octahydrocurcuminin LPS-Stimulated RAW264.7 Macrophages","Curcumin (CUR) possesses pronounced anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Generally, the clinical application of CUR is restricted due to its apparent unstability and poor absorption, and the biological activities of CUR may be closely associated with its metabolites. Tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) and octahydrocurcumin (OHC) are two major hydrogenated metabolites of CUR with appreciable biological potentials. Here, we comparatively explored the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of CUR, THC, and OHC in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced RAW264.7 macrophages. The results revealed that CUR, THC, and OHC dose-dependently inhibited the generation of NO and MCP-1 as well as the gene expression of MCP-1 and iNOS. Additionally, CUR, THC, and OHC significantly inhibited NF-B activation and p38MAPK and ERK phosphorylation, while substantially upregulated the Nrf2 target gene expression (HO-1, NQO-1, GCLC, and GCLM). Nevertheless, zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP), a typical HO-1 inhibitor, significantly reversed the alleviative effect of CUR, THC, and OHC on LPS-stimulated ROS generation. These results demonstrated that CUR, THC, and OHC exerted beneficial effect on LPS-stimulated inflammatory and oxidative responses, at least partially, through inhibiting the NF-B and MAPKs pathways and activating Nrf2-regulated antioxidant gene expression. Particularly, THC and OHC might exert superior antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities to CUR in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, which can be further explored to be a promising novel effective agent for inflammatory treatment."
Investigating the relationship between occupational exposure to nanomaterials and symptoms of nanotechnology companies' employees,"Purpose: The increasing use of nanomaterials in academic and industrial environments has raised concerns about the potential effects of these materials on human and the environment. Researches have shown that occupational exposure to nanomaterials can affect employees' health. Many companies are active in the field of nanotechnology in Iran. Therefore, this study was designed and conducted to investigate the relationship between the symptoms of these companies' employees and exposure to nanomaterials. Methods: The study was conducted among employees of 52 nanotechnology companies in Tehran. For this study, the employees of these companies were categorized in two groups: ""exposed"" and ""non-exposed"" to nanomaterials. Data collection tools included the NanoTool method form and a nonspecific symptom questionnaire designed and validated by a team of 19 experts in various fields. Finally, data were analyzed using SPSS.22 software. Results: The results showed that the frequency of cutaneous (such as roughness, itching and redness), respiratory (such as cough, sneezing, and burning throat) and ocular (such as burning, itching and redness) symptoms were higher among the exposed workers to nanomaterials. Examination of the correlation between these symptoms in the two studied groups showed that symptoms with high frequency have a significant relationship with exposure to nanomaterials. Conclusions: Given the high prevalence of some symptoms among the employees of the studied companies and their association with exposure to nanomaterials, it seems necessary to take control measures to reduce the exposure of employees to nanomaterials and consequently reduce the Investigated symptoms."
Secure application of graphene in medicine,"The unique physical properties considered of graphene to be especially perspective for photothermal therapy complex, drug address delivery to the target organs, and some other fields. Objective: The objective of our study was to explore the possible graphene impact on microorganism growth as well as on laboratory animal overall condition. Materials and technique: The experiments applied samples of graphene three concentrations and two 15 × 15 mm quartz glasses one of which carrying deposited graphene lattice. We have also used 5% blood agar, thioglycollate broth, bacterial suspensions of standard turbidity containing pure clinical isolate of microorganisms. Three white male 6-month-old laboratory rats were used to estimate the graphene impact on the overall animal condition. Results: Graphene did not contain any microorganisms, does not destroy erythrocytes placed within the artificial nutritional medium, graphene lattice did not add any properties to the quartz glasses which could allow the Proteus spread all over its surface. It was also established that graphene did not show any native antibacterial impact. No significant reaction was noticed in animals after graphene administration to laboratory rats neither at the injection spot nor at the overall level. Conclusion: Our data confirm the applicability of graphene both in scientific and practical biomedical purposes."
Oxidative stress induced by occupational exposure to nanomaterials: A systematic review,"The rapid growth of nanotechnology has increased the occupational exposure to nano-materials. On the other hand, a growing body of evidence considers exposure to these materials to be hazardous. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the effects of occupational exposure to these materials by different methods. Biological monitoring, especially the investigation of oxidative stress induced by exposure to nanomaterials, can provide useful information for researchers. This study systematically reviews studies that have investigated oxidative stress caused by occupational exposure to nanomaterials. The search was conducted on the PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases. Of the 266 studies we obtained in our initial search, eventually 11 were included in our study. There is currently no specific biomarker for investigating oxidative stress induced by exposure to nanomaterials. Therefore, the reviewed studies have used different biomarkers in different biological fluids for this purpose. Also, the methods of assessing occupational exposure to nanoma-terials in the investigated studies were very diverse. Given the approach of the investigated studies to biomarkers and exposure assessment methods, finding a specific biomarker for investigating exposure to nanomaterials seems unattainable. But reaching a group of biomarkers, to assess exposure to nanomaterials seems more applicable and achievable."
BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF NANOPARTICLES (NPs) WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ZnO NPs AND EARTHWORM,"Nanotechnology has tremendous potential to improve many sectors of science and technology such as industries, physical, chemical and biological engineering, consumer products, medical, environmental and agricultural sciences and so on. Due to specific physicochemical properties, nanoparticles behave differently from bulk materials. The extremely small size of nanoparticle enhances surface area-to-volume ratio making it highly reactive. Such unique and advantageous properties of NPs increase their applications in various fields. Huge amount of NPs is produced annually world-wide. The immense and diversified uses impose potential danger on environment and organisms. Toxicological studies of nanoparticles have opened a new branch of science i.e. nanotoxicology. There are three routes of entry of nanoparticles inside the body viz. inhalation, skin and gastrointestinal tract. Since the earthworm is a megadrile resource of pedoecosystem and occupies an important tropic level, many studies have focussed on this below-ground organism. Earthworms respire through skin and ingest soil so NPs enter through skin and/or gastrointestinal tract. Nanoparticle toxicity depends on particle size, shape, quality, coating, chemical properties and concentration of NPs as well as nature of encountering organisms. Nanoparticles have negative impact on survival, growth, development, reproduction and biochemical machinery of animals including earthworms. Literatures revealed that the behaviour, survival, biomass and fecundity of earthworm are greatly affected by nanoparticle exposure. NPs penetrate the cell and its organelles and disrupt cellular metabolism which eventually lead to cell death. In addition, NPs may break DNA helices, disrupt gene expression and impair mitochondrial functions. They generate reactive oxygen species in cells and cause oxidative stress. It embarks the need to ameliorate toxicological effects of nanoparticles through antioxidant-rich food, which can inhibit the process of oxidation and prevent formation of free radicals. In the present scenario, wide and indiscriminate use of nanoparticles should be avoided or minimized as far as possible to protect the health of animal world."
Effectiveness of nanoscale delivery systems on improving the bioavailability of lutein in rodent models: a systematic review,"Lutein, a potent antioxidant and the main macular pigment that protects the macula from light-initiated oxidative damage, has low bioavailability. Various nanoscale delivery systems have been developed for improving its bioavailability. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of nanoscale delivery systems on improving lutein bioavailability in rodent models. Using EBSCOhost and PubMed, a total of eleven peer-reviewed articles published from 2000 to 2020 were identified. Plasma lutein concentration, pharmacokinetic parameters, including maximum concentration (Cmax), area under curve (AUC), and time to reach the maximum concentration (Tmax), and lutein accumulation in organs were extracted to evaluate the bioavailability of lutein using nanoscale delivery methods as compared with unencapsulated or raw lutein. Various nanoscale delivery systems, including polymer nanoparticles, emulsions, and lutein nanoparticles, significantly improved the bioavailability of lutein, as evidenced by increased plasma lutein concentrations, Cmax, or AUC. Additionally, five out of seven studies observed enhanced accumulation of lutein in the liver and the eyes. Polymer nanoparticles and emulsions improve the dispersibility and stability of lutein, thus lutein might be more accessible in the small intestine. Lutein nanoparticles shortened the Tmax. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of nanoscale delivery systems on improving the functionalities of lutein."
"A quadrennial review of the national nanotechnology initiative: Nanoscience, applications, and commercialization","Global advances in medicine, food, water, energy, microelectronics, communications, defense, and other important sectors of the economy are increasingly driven by discoveries in nanoscience and the development of nanotechnologies. Engaging the nanoscience and technology community in the crafting of national priorities, developing novel approaches for translating fundamental discovery to a technology readiness level appropriate for venture/industry funding, increasing domestic student interest in nanoscience to expand the workforce pipeline, and exploring new ways of coordinating the work of the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) are all imperatives if the United States is to fully reap the societal benefits of nanotechnology."
1d and 2d nanomaterials-based electronics for neural interfaces,"Neural interfaces have contributed significantly to our understanding of brain functions as well as the development of neural prosthetics. An ideal neural interface should create a seamless and reliable link between the nervous system and external electronics for long periods of time. Implantable electronics that are capable of recording and stimulating neuronal activities have been widely applied for the study of neural circuits or the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the relatively large cross-sectional footprints of conventional electronics can cause acute tissue damage during implantation. In addition, the mechanical mismatch between conventional rigid electronics and soft brain tissue has been shown to induce chronic tissue inflammatory responses, leading to signal degradation during long-term studies. Thus, it is essential to develop new strategies to overcome these existing challenges and construct more stable neural interfaces. Owing to their unique physical and chemical properties, one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials constitute promising candidates for next-generation neural interfaces. In particular, novel electronics based on 1D and 2D nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), silicon nanowires (SiNWs), and graphene (GR), have been demonstrated for neural interfaces with improved performance. This review discusses recent developments in neural interfaces enabled by 1D and 2D nanomaterials and their electronics. The ability of CNTs to promote neuronal growth and electrical activity has been proven, demonstrating the feasibility of using CNTs as conducting layers or as modifying layers for electronics. Owing to their good mechanical, electrical and biological properties, CNTs-based electronics have been demonstrated for neural recording and stimulation, neurotransmitter detection, and controlled drug release. Different from CNTs-based electronics, SiNWs-based field effect transistors (FETs) and microelectrode arrays have been successfully demonstrated for intracellular recording of action potentials through penetration into neural cells. Significantly, SiNWs FETs can detect neural activity at the level of individual axons and dendrites with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Their ability to record multiplexed intracellular signals renders SiNWs-based electronics superior to traditional intracellular recording techniques such as patch-clamp recording. Besides, SiNWs have been explored for optically controlled nongenetic neuromodulation due to their tunable electrical and optical properties. As the star of the 2D nanomaterials family, GR has been applied as biomimetic substrates for neural regeneration. Transparent GR-based electronics combining electrophysiological measurements, optogenetics, two-photon microscopy with multicellular calcium imaging have been applied for the construction of multimodal neural interfaces. Finally, we provide an overview of the challenges and future perspectives of nanomaterial-based neural interfaces."
BECN2 (beclin 2)-mediated non-canonical autophagy in innate immune signaling and tumor development,"BECN2 (beclin 2) is a newly identified mammalian-specific macroautophagy/autophagy family member, and plays a critical role in the control of obesity and insulin sensitivity. However, its role in innate immune signaling and inflammation remains elusive. In our recent study, we show that BECN2 functions as a negative regulator in innate immune signaling and tumor development through non-canonical autophagy. Loss of Becn2 causes splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, elevated proinflammatory cytokine production and spontaneous lymphoma development in mice. Mechanistically, BECN2 mediates the degradation of MAP3K7/TAK1 and MAP3K3/MEKK3 through an ATG9A- and ULK1-dependent but ATG16L1-BECN1-MAP1LC3B/LC3B-independent autophagy pathway to control systemic inflammation. BECN2 interacts with MAP3K7 and MAP3K3 through the engagement of ATG9A+ vesicles upon ULK1 activation, and promotes the fusion of MAP3K3- or MAP3K7-associated ATG9A+ vesicles with phagophores for subsequent degradation. Our findings have identified a previously unrecognized role of BECN2 in innate immune signaling and tumor development through non-canonical autophagy, thus providing a potential target for inflammatory disease and cancer therapy."
Nanotechnology: Occupational health hazards of nanoparticles and legalization challenges,"Recently there has been much interest in applying nanotechnological developments to enhance human life standards with different features. Besides the inevitable advantages of nanotechnology, nanotoxicology studies have also revealed the serious hazardous effects of nanoproducts on human/animal health and the environment. In commercializing and legalizing processes of nanotechnology, it is important to take into account the toxicity aspects and ethical issues of this technology on the human and environmental safety. Occupational and consumer safety can be in danger if nanomaterials enter the human body through inhalation into the lung, dermal absorbency, digestive tract and transfer to the other organs. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) and risk assessment (RA) are two efficacious tools to evaluate the environmental effects accompanying nanoproducts. The LCA method incorporates the effect of different stages of nanomaterials production. RA denotes the overall process and procedures of analyzing and assessing the risk associated with the nanosubjects and identification of proper routes to remove them or risk control. In this chapter, we survey the hazard and toxicology of nanoparticles, occupational exposure issues, instruments and methods for the detection of nanoparticles, control methods, and available federal regulatory compliance."
Why do newly industrialized economies deter to adopt responsible research and innovation?: the case of emerging technologies in Korea,"Technologically advanced countries have recently highlighted the responsible research and innovation (RRI) approach, which aims to increase the positive effects of innovations by intervening in the early stages of technological development. It is necessary to prepare for unexpected impacts that might occur as emerging technologies continue to develop. Korea has a newly industrialized economy; therefore, it is important to examine potential RRI implementation in Korea, as RRI remains a controversial topic. Korea also lacks policy experience regarding key RRI elements, which may present barriers to future RRI implementation. This study attempts to advance RRI in Korea by using the analytical hierarchy process approach to identify and prioritize the expected RRI barriers to autonomous vehicles and biotechnology. The results indicate that economic and policy/politics barriers are the most important. Specifically, the increased innovation costs and lack of economic incentives are the most significant barriers facing RRI."

"Health and safety concerns related to CNT and graphene products, and related composites","The use of Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) and Graphene increased in the last decade and it is likely to keep increasing in the near future. The attractiveness of their properties, particularly the possibility to enhance the composites performance using a tailor made methodology, brings new materials, processes and products for highly demanding industrial applications and to the market. However, there are quite a lot of health/safety issues, as well as lack of understanding and standards to evaluate their effects. This paper starts with a general description of materials, processes and products dealing with CNT and graphene. Then, an overview of concerns related to the health and safety when handling, researching, producing and using products that include these materials is presented. It follows a risk management approach with respect to simulation and evaluation tools, and considering the consensual limits already existing for research, industry and consumers. A general discussion integrating the relevant aspects of health and safety with respect to CNT and graphene is also presented. A proactive view is presented with the intention to contribute with some guidelines on installation, maintenance, evaluation, personal protection equipment (PPE) and personnel training to deal with these carbon-based nanomaterials in research, manufacture, and use with composite materials."
Recent progresses in organic-inorganic nano technological platforms for cancer therapeutics,"Nanotechnology offers promising tools in interdisciplinary research areas and getting an upsurge of interest in cancer therapeutics.

Recently combinational therapies are catching more attention due to their enhanced effect leading towards the use of combined organic-inorganic nano platforms. The current review covers organic, inorganic and their hybrid nanomate-rials for various therapeutic action. The technological aspect of this review emphasizes on the use of inorganic-organic hybrids and combinational therapies for better results and also explores the future opportunities in this field."
Immunotoxicity Testing – In Vitro Cell Culture Models,"The understanding of how nanomaterials interact with cells, tissues, and organs is important to realize their potential for biomedical applications and for hazard assessment of occupational exposure. Depending on the nanomaterial characteristics, they can trigger various components of the immune system, that is, innate and adaptive immune systems, thereby either activating or suppressing immune system functions. In this chapter, we highlight the currently established immune cell models and readouts to address the possible effects of nanomaterials. In addition to the conventional 2D cultures, the design and use of more complex 3D models is emphasized."
Enalos suite of tools: Enhance cheminformatics and nanoinformat-ics through knime,"Drug discovery as well as (nano)material design projects demand the in silico analysis of large datasets of compounds with their corresponding properties/activities, as well as the retrieval and virtual screening of more structures in an effort to identify new potent hits. This is a demanding procedure for which various tools must be combined with different input and output formats. To automate the data analysis required we have developed the necessary tools to facilitate a variety of important tasks to construct workflows that will simplify the handling, processing and modeling of cheminformatics data and will provide time and cost efficient solutions, reproducible and easier to maintain. We therefore develop and present a toolbox of >25 processing modules, Enalos+ nodes, that provide very useful operations within KNIME platform for users interested in the nanoinformatics and cheminformatics analysis of chemical and biological data. With a user-friendly interface, Enalos+ Nodes provide a broad range of important functionalities including data mining and retrieval from large available databases and tools for robust and predictive model development and validation. Enalos+ Nodes are available through KNIME as add-ins and offer valuable tools for extracting useful information and analyzing experimental and virtual screening results in a chem-or nano-informat-ics framework. On top of that, in an effort to: (i) allow big data analysis through Enalos+ KNIME nodes, (ii) accelerate time demanding computations performed within Enalos+ KNIME nodes and (ii) propose new time and cost efficient nodes integrated within Enalos+ toolbox we have investigated and verified the advantage of GPU calculations within the Enalos+ nodes. Demonstration data sets, tutorial and educational videos allow the user to eas-ily apprehend the functions of the nodes that can be applied for in silico analysis of data."
From Nano-Communications to Body Area Networks: A Perspective on Truly Personal Communications,"This article presents an overview of future truly personal communications, ranging from networking inside the human body to the exchange of data with external wireless devices in the surrounding environment. At the nano- and micro-scales, communications can be realized with the aid of molecular mechanisms, Förster resonance energy transfer phenomenon, electromagnetic or ultrasound waves. At a larger scale, in the domain of Body Area Networks, a wide range of communication mechanisms is available, including smart-textiles, inductive- and body-couplings, ultrasounds, optical and wireless radio transmissions, a number of mature technologies existing already. The main goal of this article is to identify the potential mechanisms that can be exploited to provide interfaces in between nano- and micro-scale systems and Body Area Networks. These interfaces have to bridge the existing gap between the two worlds, in order to allow for truly personal communication systems to become a reality. The extraordinary applications of such systems are also discussed, as they are strong drivers of the research in this area."
Metal-organic framework (Mof)-based drug delivery,"Background: Developing a controllable drug delivery system is imperative and important to reduce side effects and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of drugs. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-an emerging class of hybrid porous materials built from metal ions or clusters bridged by organic linkers-have attracted increasing attention in the recent years owing to the unique physical structures possessed, and the potential for vast applications. The superior properties of MOFs, such as well-defined pore aperture, tailorable composition and structure, tunable size, versatile functionality, high agent loading, and improved biocompatibility, have made them promising candidates as drug delivery hosts. MOFs for drug delivery is of great interest and many very promising results have been found, indicating that these porous solids exhibit several advantages over existing systems. Objective: This review highlights the latest advances in the synthesis, functionalization, and applications of MOFs in drug delivery, and has classified them using drug loading strategies. Finally, challenges and future perspectives in this research area are also outlined."
Bacteria responsive polyoxometalates nanocluster strategy to regulate biofilm microenvironments for enhanced synergetic antibiofilm activity and wound healing,"Backgroud: Nowadays, biofilms that are generated as a result of antibiotic abuse cause serious threats to global public health. Such films are the primary factor that contributes to the failure of antimicrobial treatment. This is due to the fact that the films prevent antibiotic infiltration, escape from innate immune attacks by phagocytes and consequently generate bacterial resistance. Therefore, exploiting novel antibacterial agents or strategies is extremely urgent. Methods: Herein, we report a rational construction of a novel biofilm microenvironment (BME)-responsive antibacterial platform that is based on tungsten (W)-polyoxometalate clusters (POMs) to achieve efficient bactericidal effects. Results: On one hand, the acidity and reducibility of a BME could lead to the self-assembly of POMs to produce large aggregates, which favor biofilm accumulation and enhance photothermal conversion under near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation. On the other hand, reduced POM aggregates with BME-induced photothermal-enhanced efficiency also exhibit surprisingly high peroxidase-like activity in the catalysis of bacterial endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS). This enhances biofilm elimination and favors antibacterial effects. Most importantly, reduced POMs exhibit the optimal peroxidase-like activity in an acidic BME. Conclusion: Therefore, in addition to providing a prospective antibacterial agent, intelligent acid/reductive dual-responsive POMs will establish a new representative paradigm for the areas of healthcare with minimal side effects."
Recent advances in Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>as anode materials for high-performance lithium-ion batteries,"Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely applied as energy storage devices for large-scale electrical vehicle markets. Designing and ameliorating new or existing anodes are in high demand to meet the requirements of the next generation LIBs with higher energy/power densities, more excellent rate capability and longer cycling performance. Co3O4-based materials have drawn great attention as potential alternatives to the current graphite anodes due to the high capacity, abundant reserves of resource, moderate price, and simple preparation process. However, their inherent shortcoming of low conductivity and huge volume changes limit the practical applications. Different approaches have been applied to overcome these drawbacks. Herein, we summarize the recent developments in high-performance Co3O4anode materials from their architectures, including 0D nanostructures (nanospheres, nanocrystals, nanoparticles, nanocages and nanocubes), 1D nanostructures (nanowires, nanofibers, nanorods and nanotubes), 2D nanostructures (nanosheets, nanofoils, nanoflakes and nanofilms), and 3D structures (microsized cages, hollow structures, mesoporous structure, flower-like structure). We expect that this review will shed light on the structure-property relationship for rational design and synthesis of Co3O4-based materials and promote the practical application."
Fast quantification and speciation of selenium in dietary supplements through handheld XRF and synchrotron radiation XAS,"The handheld X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) has the advantages of being easy to carry, simple in operation, non-destructive, and offers fast and relatively accurate detection, while synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) has been used for the selenium (Se) speciation of Se-enriched yeast and Se hyperaccumulators. In this study, we propose the application of a handheld XRF in combination with XAS for the fast quantification and speciation of Se in commercially available dietary supplements. The results of total Se determined by handheld XRF were in good agreement with ICP-MS data, which was also consistent with the labeled value of Se dietary supplements. The XAS analysis of the tested samples showed that Se was mainly present in the form of organic Se. The proposed method is practical and simple for high throughput label verification and quality control of Se dietary supplements. It can, therefore, be a useful method not only for researchers but also for regulators and producers in the analysis of Se dietary supplements."
Routes of exposures and toxicity of nanoparticles,"Nanotechnology is a vast growing research niche and has found its application in diverse fields. The vast applications include the environment, chemical, biological, electronics, medicine, and sports. The miniature size and high surface area of nanoparticles (NPs) do cause increased toxicological effects on various organisms. To know the effects of NPs exposure, the current chapter presents the various routes of exposures and its toxicity on different model systems. Different NPs can pass through the host system via the skin, olfactory route, respiratory tract, and oral route. The entry of these NPs in the following routes may be either during their production, use, intentional, or unintentional. The entry of NPs in the following routes may lead to negative biological effects. The key points for discussion in this chapter include the routes of exposure of different NPs and their toxicology impact at that particular point of entry and the target organ."
Regulatory considerations for safety of nanomaterials,"Nanoparticles are continuously being used in various industries on a daily basis, exposing both humans and environment. As previous studies indicate, these nanomaterials tend to cause serious health effects in humans and other biological species. This leads to a dire need to set up specific regulations and guidelines for usage and disposal of these nanoparticles. In order to set up these guidelines, certain factors need important considerations such as physicochemical properties of nanomaterials, their release into environment, portal of their entry into the human body, and their relative toxicities. Therefore, it is mandatory to mend the challenges faced during setting up of these regulations. This chapter focuses on explaining various factors that need to be considered for setting up regulations for proper usage of these nanomaterials and also highlights currently existing regulation around the world."
Toxicity assessment for safe-by-design nanomaterials using advanced data analytics,"Nanomaterials (NM) have revolutionized modern science and technology due to their multiple applications in engineering, physics, chemistry, and biomedicine. Nevertheless, the manufacturing and use of NMs rises concerns in terms of their potential effects on human health and the environment. The EC has invested a significant amount of money for the studying of different NMs and the measurement of their toxicity. Within this framework there is an increasing interest for predictive tools, usually in the form of quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR), to classify NMs according to their ecotoxic and cytotoxic effect. This work uses a large amount of experimental data to create a QSAR model for NM toxicity classification. We discuss the challenges behind this problem, and explain the need for advanced analytics in the form of machi ne learning (ML) algorithms to ensure high predictive capacity of the classifier models. The case studies present new machine learning tools, compare their performance against a well-established generalized linear model and demonstrate how these tools can support the reduction of experimental effort."
Complement Activation by Nanomaterials,"Complement represents one of the most important innate immune pathways of neutralization of invading pathogens. With years, there has been an increasing awareness of the role of complement in recognition and clearance of engineered nanomaterials including nanopharmaceuticals. Here, we review the main pathways of complement activation, the assays used to characterize complement activation by nanopharmaceuticals, briefly discuss biological/clinical implications of nanomaterial-mediated complement incitement processes, and strategies to avoid complement activation."
Nanofinished medical textiles and their potential impact to health and environment,"In spite of the fact that nanofinished medical textiles have gigantic potential for a large group of utilizations, their unfavorable impacts on living cells have raised genuine concerns after utilization in the human services and customer segments; due to that they are too small and can penetrate the living cell walls easily, so they can have a very harmful effect on both the environment and the population. Besides the importance of engineered nanomaterials and all their varieties of applications, yet there is an information hole between the innovative advancement in nanotechnology and nanosafety, which made a few concerning organizations to give the most noteworthy need to researches related to the safety and health in occupational settings. This chapter introduces an overview of the nanofinished medical textiles both reusable and disposable and their potential effects on both the consumer and the environment. Moreover, the safety and health concerns identified with nanomaterials and the adverse potential of their waste are displayed."
Nanotechnological risks and their international and national regulation: Its importance in the context of time and human rights,"Objective: The present article aims to discuss the risks inherent the new technologies, especially nanotechnology, to the environment and, consequently, to human beings. From this point of view, it presents the evidence of risks pointed out by scholars as well as the discussions already performed at an international level considering their necessary and emerging regulation. Methodology: This article uses the methodology of literature survey and a systemic-constructivist framework to approach the risks, in the light of Niklas Luhmann’s concept of society of risk to discuss why nanotechnological risks should be taken into account. Results: The investigation has as conclusion that, despite the clear evidence of risks, so far there has been no regulation aiming at the development of this technology with investments in safety for the purpose of controlling environmental and human risks. Important issues must be taken into account in the national internal development of a “nanolaw”. Contributions: As a contribution, this paper discusses some of the main events already held at an international level focusing on the regulation of nanotechnology for its safe development with regard to the environment and human beings. At these events reports were issued supporting the need to share information and also to enter into an international agreement on safety measures designed to face nanotechnologial risks by implementing risk management."
Complementary autophagy inhibition and glucose metabolism with rattle-structured polydopamine@mesoporous silica nanoparticles for augmented low-temperature photothermal therapy and in vivo photoacoustic imaging,"Rattle-structured nanoparticles with movable cores, porous shells and hollow interiors have shown great effectiveness in drug delivery and cancer theranostics. Targeting autophagy and glucose have provided alternative strategies for cancer intervention therapy. Herein, rattle-structured polydopamine@mesoporous silica nanoparticles were prepared for in vivo photoacoustic (PA) imaging and augmented low-temperature photothermal therapy (PTT) via complementary autophagy inhibition and glucose metabolism. Methods: The multifunctional rattle-structured nanoparticles were designed with the nanocore of PDA and the nanoshell of hollow mesoporous silica (PDA@hm) via a four-step process. PDA@hm was then loaded with autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) and conjugated with glucose consumer glucose oxidase (GOx) (PDA@hm@CQ@GOx), forming a corona-like structure nanoparticle. Results: The CQ and GOx were loaded into the cavity and decorated onto the surface of PDA@hm, respectively. The GOx-mediated tumor starvation strategy would directly suppress the expression of HSP70 and HSP90, resulting in an enhanced low-temperature PTT induced by PDA nanocore. In addition, autophagy inhibition by the released CQ made up for the loss of low-temperature PTT and starvation efficiencies by PTT- and starvation-activated autophagy, realizing augmented therapy efficacy. Furthermore, the PDA nanocore in the PDA@hm@CQ@GOx could be also used for PA imaging. Conclusion: Such a “drugs” loaded rattle-structured nanoparticle could be used for augmented low-temperature PTT through complementarily regulating glucose metabolism and inhibiting autophagy and in vivo photoacoustic imaging."
Fullerenol Nanoparticles Eradicate Helicobacter pylori via pH-Responsive Peroxidase Activity,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication by antibiotics and proton pump inhibitor treatment is limited by the low pH microenvironment in the stomach and can lead to antibiotic resistance. We fabricated fullerenol nanoparticles (FNPs) with varied chemical structures responding to a pinacol rearrangement of vicinal hydroxyl to form carbonyls in low pH environments. An obvious increase in C-O/C-O was induced in low pH and was positively correlated with a peroxidase-like activity. The FNPs exerted an excellent effect on H. pylori eradication in vitro and in vivo because of their peroxidase-like activity. FNP treatment of a H. pylori biofilm revealed that FNPs broke down polysaccharides in cell wall components, resulting in collapse of the bacteria. The cycles of FNPs combining and dissociating with the peroxidase substrate were detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and confirmed that FNPs enhance peroxidase-like activity. Further, the isothermal titration calorimetry results showed that FNPs with more C-O/C-O had greater affinity to bind the peroxidase substrates. Therefore, we suggest that varied C-O/C-O serves as a switch to respond to low pH in the stomach to kill H. pylori by inducing a peroxidase-like activity. FNPs can also overcome the challenge of antibiotic resistance to achieve H. pylori eradication in the stomach."
Human exposure to synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) is generally negligible as compared to natural compounds with higher or comparable endocrine activity. How to evaluate the risk of the S-EDCs?,"Theoretically, both synthetic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) and natural (exogenous and endogenous) endocrine-disrupting chemicals (N-EDCs) can interact with endocrine receptors and disturb hormonal balance. However, compared to endogenous hormones, S-EDCs are only weak partial agonists with receptor affinities several orders of magnitude lower than S-EDCs. Thus, to elicit observable effects, S-EDCs require considerably higher concentrations to attain sufficient receptor occupancy or to displace natural hormones and other endogenous ligands. Significant exposures to exogenous N-EDCs may result from ingestion of foods such as soy-based diets, green tea, and sweet mustard. While their potencies are lower as compared to natural endogenous hormones, they usually are considerably more potent than S-EDCs. Effects of exogenous N-EDCs on the endocrine system were observed at high dietary intakes. A causal relation between their mechanism of action and these effects is established and biologically plausible. In contrast, the assumption that the much lower human exposures to S-EDCs may induce observable endocrine effects is not plausible. Hence, it is not surprising that epidemiological studies searching for an association between S-EDC exposure and health effects have failed. Regarding testing for potential endocrine effects, a scientifically justified screen should use in vitro tests to compare potencies of S-EDCs with those of reference N-EDCs. When the potency of the S-EDC is similar or smaller than that of the N-EDC, further testing in laboratory animals and regulatory consequences are not warranted."
Effectual Anticancer Potentiality of Loaded Bee Venom onto Fungal Chitosan Nanoparticles,"Chitosan and its nanoparticles (NPs) could be extracted from numerous fungal species and used as effectual carriers for bioactive compounds. The fungal chitosan (FC) was innovatively acquired from Fusarium oxysporum grown mycelia, characterized and used for NP synthesis and loading with bee venom (BV). The nano-FC (NFC) had 192.4 nm mean NP diameter, 38.22% loading capacity, and 92.42% entrapment efficiency. BV release from NFC was pH and time dependent; burst BV release was detected at the first 6 h, followed by gradual releases up to 30 h. The in vitro anticancer potentiality valuation, of NFC, BV, and NFC/BV nanoconjugates against HeLa cervix carcinoma, revealed that they all had potent dose-dependent anticancer activity; BV/NFC nanoconjugates were the most effective with IC50=200 μg/mL. The fluorescent staining of treated HeLa cells with BV/NFC nanoconjugates, with DAPI and acridine orange/propidium iodide combination, indicated the appearance of early apoptosis, secondary apoptosis, and secondary necrosis markers and their increment with exposure prolongation. The production of NFC from F. oxysporum and their loading with BV are strongly counseled for production of potent natural antitumor agent with augmented activity against cervix carcinoma."
"Endoplasmic reticulum stress mediated apoptosis via jnk in mwcnt-exposed in vitro systems: Size, surface functionalization and cell type specificity","The aim of the present study was to evaluate the underlying mechanism of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) induced cellular response and their potential cross-talk, specifically, between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, MAPK activation and apoptosis and how these nano-bio interactions depend on the physico-chemical properties of MWCNT. For this purpose, human bronchial epithelial (Beas2B) and human hepatoma (HepG2) cell lines, were exposed to five kinds of MWCNTs which dif-fer in functionalization and aspect ratios. Tissue-specific sensitivity was evident for calcium homeostasis, ER-stress response, MAPK activation and apoptosis, which further depended on surface functionalization as well as aspect ratios of MWCNT. By applying specific pharmaceutical inhibitors, relevant biomarkers gene and proteins expressions, we found that possibly MWCNT induce activation of IRE1α-XPB1 path-way-mediated ER-stress response, which in turn trigger apoptosis through JNK activation in both type of cells but with variable intensity. The information presented here would have relevance in better understanding of MWCNT toxicity and their safer applications."
Adaptive changes induced by noble-metal nanostructures in vitro and in vivo,"The unique features of noble-metal nanostructures (NMNs) are leading to unprecedented expansion of research and exploration of their application in therapeutics, diagnostics and bioimaging fields. With the ever-growing applications of NMNs, both therapeutic and environmental NMNs are likely to be exposed to tissues and organs, requiring careful studies towards their biological effects in vitro and in vivo. Upon NMNs exposure, tissues and cells may undergo a series of adaptive changes both in morphology and function. At the cellular level, the accumulation of NMNs in various subcellular organelles including lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and nucleus may interfere with their functions, causing changes in a variety of cellular functions, such as digestion, protein synthesis and secretion, energy metabolism, mitochondrial respiration, and proliferation. In animals, retention of NMNs in metabolic-, respiratory-, immune-related, and other organs can trigger significant physiological and pathological changes to these organs and influence their functions. Exploring how NMNs interact with tissues and cells and the underlying mechanisms are of vital importance for their future applications. Here, we illustrate the characteristics of NMNs-induced adaptive changes both in vitro and in vivo. Potential strategies in the design of NMNs are also discussed to take advantage of beneficial adaptive changes and avoid unfavorable changes for the proper implementation of these nanoplatforms."
Identification of physicochemical properties that modulate nanoparticle aggregation in blood,"Inorganic materials are receiving significant interest in medicine given their usefulness for therapeutic applications such as targeted drug delivery, active pharmaceutical carriers and medical imaging. However, poor knowledge of the side effects related to their use is an obstacle to clinical translation. For the development of molecular drugs, the concept of safe-by-design has become an efficient pharmaceutical strategy with the aim of reducing costs, which can also accelerate the translation into the market. In the case of materials, the application these approaches is hampered by poor knowledge of how the physical and chemical properties of the material trigger the biological response. Hemocompatibility is a crucial aspect to take into consideration for those materials that are intended for medical applications. The formation of nanoparticle agglomerates can cause severe side effects that may induce occlusion of blood vessels and thrombotic events. Additionally, nanoparticles can interfere with the coagulation cascade causing both pro-and anti-coagulant properties. There is contrasting evidence on how the physicochemical properties of the material modulate these effects. In this work, we developed two sets of tailored carbon and silica nanoparticles with three different diameters in the 100-500 nm range with the purpose of investigating the role of surface curvature and chemistry on platelet aggregation, activation and adhesion. Substantial differences were found in the composition of the protein corona depending on the chemical nature of the nanoparticles, while the surface curvature was found to play a minor role. On the other hand, large carbon nanoparticles (but not small carbon nanoparticles or silica nanoparticles) have a clear tendency to form aggregates both in plasma and blood. This effect was observed both in the presence or absence of platelets and was independent of platelet activation. Overall, the results presented herein suggest the existence of independent modes of action that are differently affected by the physicochemical properties of the materials, potentially leading to vessel occlusion and/or formation of thrombi in vivo."
Immunotoxicity of therapeutic antibodies and nanoparticles,"Therapeutic antibodies and nanotherapeutic drugs are of great concern due to their widespread use against numerous diseases worldwide. They are frequently used for targeted therapy under the assumption that they cause fewer side effects than nontargeted drugs. Despite their specificity and particular design for therapeutic actions, they might still exhibit unintended adverse effects in the immune system. Immunotoxicity reactions are mediated by immunomodulation, including immunostimulation and immunosuppression. The present review gives an overview on the adverse immunotoxic effects induced by therapeutic antibodies as well as nanotherapeutic drugs. In this context, future methods combining more efficient drug design with better tolerability and fewer adverse effects are discussed to ensure improved safety in the engineering of therapeutic antibodies and nanotherapeutics."
Surface engineering of metal–organic framework as pH-/NIR-responsive nanocarrier for imaging-guided chemo-photothermal therapy,"Background: Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted intensive research interest in the biomedical field because of their unique properties. However, in order to realize the high loading capacity and therapeutic efficacy, it is still urgent to develop a multifunctional MOFs-based nanoplatform. Materials and Methods: Herein, a pH/near-infrared (NIR) dual-responsive drug delivery system based on zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) is constructed for synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy and dual-modal magnetic resonance (MR)/photoacoustic (PA) imaging. The doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) is embedded into ZIF-8 through one-pot method, and the resultant ZIF-8/DOX is then successively modified with polydopamine, Mn ions and poly(ethylene glycol). The obtained ZIF-8/DMPP is systematically characterized, and both its in vitro and in vivo biological effects are evaluated in detail. Results: The ZIF-8/DMPP possesses a high drug-loading content of 18.9% and displays appropriate size and morphology. The pH-dependent degradation and drug release behavior of prepared ZIF-8/DMPP are confirmed. Importantly, the results demonstrate that the photo-thermal effect of ZIF-8/DMPP under NIR laser irradiation can significantly accelerate its drug releasing rate, further improving the intracellular drug concentrations. Thereafter, the augmented chemotherapeutic efficiency by photothermal effect against cancer cells is ver-ified both in vitro and in vivo. Besides, the favorable MR and PA imaging capacity of ZIF-8/ DMPP is also evidenced on the tumor model. Conclusion: Taken together, the surface engineering of ZIF-8-based nanocarrier in this work offers a promising strategy for the multifunctional MOFs-based drug delivery system."
"Complement activation by drug carriers and particulate pharmaceuticals: Principles, challenges and opportunities","Considering the multifaceted protective and homeostatic roles of the complement system, many consequences arise when drug carriers, and particulate pharmaceutical formulations clash with complement proteins, and trigger complement cascade. Complement activation may induce formulation destabilization, promote opsonization, and affect biological and therapeutic performance of pharmaceutical nano- and micro-particles. In some cases, complement activation is beneficial, where complement may play a role in prophylactic protection, whereas uncontrolled complement activation is deleterious, and contributes to disease progression. Accordingly, design initiatives with particulate medicines should consider complement activation properties of the end formulation within the context of administration route, dosing, systems biology, and therapeutic perspective. Here we examine current progress in mechanistic processes underlying complement activation by pre-clinical and clinical particles, identify opportunities and challenges ahead, and suggest future directions in nanomedicine-complement interface research."
Graphene and other 2D materials: A multidisciplinary analysis to uncover the hidden potential as cancer theranostics,"Cancer represents one of the main causes of death in the world; hence the development of more specific approaches for its diagnosis and treatment is urgently needed in clinical practice. Here we aim at providing a comprehensive review on the use of 2-dimensional materials (2DMs) in cancer theranostics. In particular, we focus on graphene-related materials (GRMs), graphene hybrids, and graphdiyne (GDY), as well as other emerging 2DMs, such as MXene, tungsten disulfide (WS2), molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), black phosphorus (BP), silicene, antimonene (AM), germanene, biotite (black mica), metal organic frameworks (MOFs), and others. The results reported in the scientific literature in the last ten years (>200 papers) are dissected here with respect to the wide variety of combinations of imaging methodologies and therapeutic approaches, including drug/gene delivery, photothermal/photodynamic therapy, sonodynamic therapy, and immunotherapy. We provide a unique multidisciplinary approach in discussing the literature, which also includes a detailed section on the characterization methods used to analyze the material properties, highlighting the merits and limitations of the different approaches. The aim of this review is to show the strong potential of 2DMs for use as cancer theranostics, as well as to highlight issues that prevent the clinical translation of these materials. Overall, we hope to shed light on the hidden potential of the vast panorama of new and emerging 2DMs as clinical cancer theranostics."
Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles in cancer diagnosis and therapy,"Due to their lower systemic toxicity, faster kidney clearance and higher tumor accumulation, ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (less than 10 nm in diameter) have been proved to be promising in biomedical applications. However, their potential applications in cancer imaging and treatment have not been reviewed yet. This review summarizes the efforts to develop systems based on ultrasmall gold nanoparticles for use in cancer diagnosis and therapy. First, we describe the methods for controlling the size and surface functionalization of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles. Second, we review the research on ultrasmall gold nanoparticles in cancer imaging and treatment. Specifically, we focus on the applications of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles in tumor visualization and bioimaging in different fields such as magnetic resonance imaging, photoacoustic imaging, fluorescence imaging, and X-ray scatter imaging. We also highlight the applications of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles in tumor chemotherapy, radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy and gene therapy."
Current challenges and coming opportunities in nanoparticle risk assessment,"This chapter discusses the key aspects of engineered nanomaterial (ENM) toxicity. The individual properties of ENMs affecting their toxic potential are described, with a special focus on size, shape, and surface charge and functionalization. We present empirical evidence from a range of in vitro and in vivo studies showing potential adverse effects induced via inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact with ENMs, as well as a brief overview of human studies and nanoecotoxicology. Finally, a summary of current guidelines and frameworks is provided, together with a collection of the most prominent nanosafety projects and resources available for the assessment of nanotoxicity. This literature review demonstrates that there is a need for the collection of standardized data from human studies to inform epidemiological studies. Moreover, despite the wide usage of ENMs and reported toxic potentials, there is a shortage of policies regulating the exposure and usage of ENMs to protect both the environment and human health."
Preparation process for oral dissolving film of ginkgolide B for treatment of Alzheimer's disease,"Objective: Ginkgolide B (GB) has been applied to cardiovascular diseases in clinic with its anti-oxidative and anti-aging effects. GB plays a neuroprotective role in models of various diseases. A study showns that Aβ1-42 induces oxidative damage to the cellular biomolecules, which are associated with AD pathology, and are protected by the pre-treatment of GB against Aβ-toxicity. We prepared the oral dissolving film (ODF) of GB by tape casting. The influence of film forming material, plasticizer and defoamer on the performance of the ODF of GB was studied. ODF has better adherence and is easy to take, which provides certain reference value for future nerve agents. Methods: The preparation parameters were as follows: 35mg GB was dissolved with 70ml of distilled water and mixed well, which was followed by the addition of 0.5g of glycerol as the plasticizer. After complete dissolution, 2g of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose was added as the film forming material. An ODF solution was formed by mixing, during which two to three drops of edible defoamer were added. After defoaming, the solution was coated onto the carrier sheet and left to stand until complete drying. Then the film was cut into a proper size. Results: Experiments showed that the ODF of GB could completely dissolve in 280s and 80% of GB was released in 1min. The degree of release reached100% in 3min. This drug was pasted onto the supralingual area of 0.6×1.3mm with a single dose of 1mg/kg for the rats. Pharmacokinetic parameters were measured, and the clearance rate CL (L/h) was calculated as 2.156, Cmax (ng•mL-1): 13.52, Tmax: 4h. Conclusion: The AUC for the ODF of GB was larger by about 1.77-fold as compared with the intragastric administration of GB. The bioavailability of ODF of the drug was higher than other conventional oral preparations."
A Microfluidic Chip for Circulating Tumor Cells RNA Sequencing at Single Cell Level,"Here we present an integrated microfluidic chip for single cell RNA sequencing of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). All procedures of single cell RNA sequencing of specific cells in human peripheral blood were integrated in a single microfluidic chip, including blood filtration, CTCs enrichment, single CTC isolation and identification, single cell RNA reverse transcription and cDNA amplification. Our results realized the aim of 'whole blood in, SMART-SEQ II product out' at single CTC level in a microfluidic chip."
Interference of gold nanoparticles with in vitro endotoxin detection assays,"Background: Endotoxin-free engineered nanoparticle suspensions are imperative for their successful applications in the field of nanomedicine as well as in the investigations in their toxicity. Gold nanoparticles are known to interfere with various in vitro assays due to their optical properties and potential for surface reactivity. In vitro endotoxin testing assays are known to be susceptible to interference caused by the sample being tested. Objective: This study aimed to identify a preferred assay for the testing of endotoxin contamination in gold nanoparticle suspensions. Methods: The interference by gold nanoparticles on three assays namely, the commonly used limulus amebocyte lysate chromogenic assay, the limulus amebocyte lysate gel-clot method, and the less common recombinant Factor C (rFC) assay, was tested. Results: Possible interference could be observed with all three assays. The interference with the ab-sorbance-based chromogenic assay could not be overcome by dilution; whilst the qualitative nature of the gel-clot assay excluded the possibility of distinguishing between a false positive result due to enhancement of the sensitivity of the assay, and genuine endotoxin contamination. However, interference with the rFC assay was easily overcome through dilution. Conclusion: The rFC assay is recommended as an option for endotoxin contamination detection in gold nanoparticle suspensions."
Interactions at the cell membrane and pathways of internalization of nano-sized materials for nanomedicine,"Nano-sized materials have great potential as drug carriers for nanomedicine applications. Thanks to their size, they can exploit the cellular machinery to enter cells and be trafficked intracellularly, thus they can be used to overcome some of the cellular barriers to drug delivery. Nano-sized drug carriers of very different properties can be prepared, and their surface can be modified by the addition of targeting moieties to recognize specific cells. However, it is still difficult to understand how the material properties affect the subsequent interactions and outcomes at cellular level. As a consequence of this, designing targeted drugs remains a major challenge in drug delivery. Within this context, we discuss the current understanding of the initial steps in the interactions of nano-sized materials with cells in relation to nanomedicine applications. In particular, we focus on the difficult interplay between the initial adhesion of nano-sized materials to the cell surface, the potential recognition by cell receptors, and the subsequent mechanisms cells use to internalize them. The factors affecting these initial events are discussed. Then, we briefly describe the different pathways of endocytosis in cells and illustrate with some examples the challenges in understanding how nanomaterial properties, such as size, charge, and shape, affect the mechanisms cells use for their internalization. Technical difficulties in characterizing these mechanisms are presented. A better understanding of the first interactions of nano-sized materials with cells will help to design nanomedicines with improved targeting."
NanoSolveIT Project: Driving nanoinformatics research to develop innovative and integrated tools for in silico nanosafety assessment,"Nanotechnology has enabled the discovery of a multitude of novel materials exhibiting unique physicochemical (PChem) properties compared to their bulk analogues. These properties have led to a rapidly increasing range of commercial applications; this, however, may come at a cost, if an association to long-term health and environmental risks is discovered or even just perceived. Many nanomaterials (NMs) have not yet had their potential adverse biological effects fully assessed, due to costs and time constraints associated with the experimental assessment, frequently involving animals. Here, the available NM libraries are analyzed for their suitability for integration with novel nanoinformatics approaches and for the development of NM specific Integrated Approaches to Testing and Assessment (IATA) for human and environmental risk assessment, all within the NanoSolveIT cloud-platform. These established and well-characterized NM libraries (e.g. NanoMILE, NanoSolutions, NANoREG, NanoFASE, caLIBRAte, NanoTEST and the Nanomaterial Registry (>2000 NMs)) contain physicochemical characterization data as well as data for several relevant biological endpoints, assessed in part using harmonized Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) methods and test guidelines. Integration of such extensive NM information sources with the latest nanoinformatics methods will allow NanoSolveIT to model the relationships between NM structure (morphology), properties and their adverse effects and to predict the effects of other NMs for which less data is available. The project specifically addresses the needs of regulatory agencies and industry to effectively and rapidly evaluate the exposure, NM hazard and risk from nanomaterials and nano-enabled products, enabling implementation of computational ‘safe-by-design’ approaches to facilitate NM commercialization."
An algebraic-analytic model for the characterization of the frequency domain of photodiodes,"A design and principle of silicon photodiodes (PD) operation in the frequency domain are presented. To further enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, a methodology is proposed regarding how to cut down the response in the frequency domain between the time constant and stability characteristics. An algebraic-analytic model is developed to obtain the frequency behavior of the PD which are used as semiconductor devices to capture optical modulated light. The proposed model consists of connecting the anode and cathode terminals of a PD, an operational amplifier (AOP) for performing a control over the frequency domain optical device. The basic idea consists in analyzing the response of the PD at different frequencies using Bode, Nyquist and Black diagrams which have been obtained by a transfer function in the frequency domain when the optical response is attenuated. Consequently, a cutoff frequency to be determined by a test signal, and thus allowing for a certain range of frequency capture for operation and application of the PD. This paper highlights several key issues in the measurement methods on frequency domain of the Si PD. In some cases, indirect signal metering of modulated light presents unwanted signals. Consequently, the RC filter responses they are frequency filtering effect. Therefore, for the improved PD measurements, might be necessary the solution in the frequency domain for transfer function and theoretical-experimental relationship on materials testing. The results show that this system has the capacity to acquire the operating range in the frequency domain and thereby calculate the cutoff frequency through the solution of the real and imaginary part of the PD-AOP transfer function model."

Synergetic Tumor Probes for Facilitating Therapeutic Delivery by Combined-Functionalized Peptide Ligands,"Both targeting and penetrating ability are the key characteristics for tissue probing and precise delivery. To construct an efficient nano probing and delivery system toward human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive cancer, we established a nano liposomal system functionalized with a newly screened HER2 targeting peptide (HP2, YDLKEPEH) and the cell-penetrating peptide TAT simultaneously. Compared with the monofunctionalized liposomal probes, the dual-functional ones demonstrated a synergetic effect in cell uptake, drug delivery, and in vivo imaging. The improved efficacy of the synergetic system provides a prospective strategy for cancer diagnosis and therapy."
Near-Infrared Laser-Triggered in Situ Dimorphic Transformation of BF<inf>2</inf>-Azadipyrromethene Nanoaggregates for Enhanced Solid Tumor Penetration,"The shape of a drug delivery system impacts its in vivo behavior such as circulation time, accumulation, and penetration. Considering the advantages of functional dyes in bioapplications, we synthesize a class of nanoaggregates based on BF2-azadipyrromethene (aza-BODIPY) dyes, which can realize long blood circulation and deep tumor penetration simultaneously in vivo through morphological transformation modulated by a near-infrared (NIR) laser. First, when the temperature increases, the wormlike nanofibers of the aza-BODIPY-1 aggregate, possessing a long blood circulation time, can be transformed into spherical nanoparticles, which are conducive to increasing the penetration in the solid tumor. Second, without any postmodification, the nanofibers exhibit an outstandingly narrow absorption band in the NIR spectral range, so that they possess ideal photothermal properties. Through 655 nm laser irradiation, the intrinsic photothermal effect causes a local temperature increase to â&circ;48 °C, realizing the transformation of 1-NFs to 1-NPs. Third, the morphological transformation is real-time detected by photoacoustic (PA) imaging. By monitoring the change of the PA signal at a specific wavelength, the in vivo deformation process of nanomaterials can be traced. Consequently, the in situ morphology transformation of aza-BODIPY-based nanomaterials can simultaneously realize long blood circulation and deep penetration, resulting in the enhanced antitumor outcome. ©"
Polysaccharides against viruses: Immunostimulatory properties and the delivery of antiviral vaccines and drugs,"Because viruses still represent a significant threat to human and animal health worldwide, the development of effective weapons against viral infections remains a top priority for the biopharmaceutical industry. This article reviews the dietary and pharmaceutical applications of polysaccharides (PS), first of all chitosan, in the prevention and treatment of viral diseases, focusing more particularly on solid or gel micro/nanoparticulate systems. The intrinsic antiviral activity of PS and their immunostimulatory effects, implemented in animal and human diets, are first surveyed. Then the review discusses the potential of PS-based particles as carriers of antiviral drugs and vaccines, with emphasis on the adjuvant potency of PS in solid vaccine formulations. The gap between the abundance of academic studies in this area and the lack of actual antiviral formulations dispensed to human patients is underlined, notwithstanding a number of branded products on the market."
Gold clusters prevent breast cancer bone metastasis by suppressing tumor-induced osteoclastogenesis,"Rationale: Bone is the most frequent site for breast cancer metastasis, which accounts for the leading cause of death in advanced breast cancer patients. Serious skeletal-related events (SREs) caused by bone metastasis have a decisive impact on the life expectancy of breast cancer patients, making breast cancer almost incurable. Metastatic breast cancer cell induced pathological osteoclastogenesis is a key driver of bone metastasis and osteolytic bone lesions. We previously reported that gold clusters can prevent inflammation induced osteoclastogenesis and osteolysis in vivo. In this study, we investigated the effects of a BSA-coated gold cluster on metastatic breast cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro and tumor-induced osteolysis in vivo, and elucidated its possible mechanism. Methods: Breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was used to evaluate the regulatory effects of gold clusters on breast cancer metastasis and tumor induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Cell counting kit-8, transwell, wound-healing and colony formation assays were performed to evaluate the effect of gold clusters on proliferation and metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and filamentous-actin rings analysis were used to detect the regulatory effects of gold clusters on MDA-MB-231 cell-conditioned medium (MDA-MB-231 CM) triggered and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis in mouse bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMs). A mouse model of breast cancer bone metastasis was used to evaluate the in vivo activity of the gold cluster on the tumor induced osteolysis. Results: The gold clusters suppressed the migration, invasion and colony formation of MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. The gold clusters strongly inhibited both MDA-MB-231 CM triggered and RANKL-induced osteoclast formation from BMMs in vitro. Cell studies indicated that the gold clusters suppressed the expression of osteolysis-related factors in MDA-MB-231 cells and inhibited the subsequent activation of NF-κB pathway in BMMs. Treatment with the clusters at a dose of 10 mg Au/kg.bw significantly reduces the breast cancer cell induced osteolysis in vivo. Conclusion: Therefore, the gold clusters may offer new therapeutic agents for preventing breast cancer bone metastasis and secondary osteolysis to improve patient outcomes."
A protein corona adsorbed to a bacterial magnetosome affects its cellular uptake,"Purpose: It is well known that when exposed to human blood plasma, nanoparticles are predominantly coated by a layer of proteins, forming a corona that will mediate the subsequent cell interactions. Magnetosomes are protein-rich membrane nanoparticles which are synthesized by magnetic bacteria; these have gained a lot of attention owing to their unique magnetic and biochemical characteristics. Nevertheless, whether bacterial magnetosomes have a corona after interacting with the plasma, and how such a corona affects nanoparticle–cell interactions is yet to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to characterize corona formation around a bacterial magnetosome and to assess the functional consequences. Methods: Magnetosomes were isolated from the magnetotactic bacteria, M. gryphiswaldense (MSR-1). Size, morphology, and zeta potential were measured by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. A quantitative characterization of plasma corona proteins was performed using LC-MS/MS. Protein absorption was further examined by circular dichro-ism and the effect of the corona on cellular uptake was investigated by microscopy and spectroscopy. Results: Various serum proteins were found to be selectively adsorbed on the surface of the bacterial magnetosomes following plasma exposure, forming a corona. Compared to the pristine magnetosomes, the acquired corona promoted efficient cellular uptake by human vascular endothelial cells. Using a protein-interaction prediction method, we identified cell surface receptors that could potentially associate with abundant corona components. Of these, one abundant corona protein, ApoE, may be responsible for internalization of the magnetosome-corona complex through LDL receptor-mediated internalization. Conclusion: Our findings provide clues as to the physiological response to magnetosomes and also reveal the corona composition of this membrane-coated nanomaterial after exposure to blood plasma."
Comprehensive understanding of magnetic hyperthermia for improving antitumor therapeutic efficacy,"Magnetic hyperthermia (MH) has been introduced clinically as an alternative approach for the focal treatment of tumors. MH utilizes the heat generated by the magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) when subjected to an alternating magnetic field (AMF). It has become an important topic in the nanomedical field due to their multitudes of advantages towards effective antitumor therapy such as high biosafety, deep tissue penetration, and targeted selective tumor killing. However, in order for MH to progress and to realize its paramount potential as an alternative choice for cancer treatment, tremendous challenges have to be overcome. Thus, the efficiency of MH therapy needs enhancement. In its recent 60-year of history, the field of MH has focused primarily on heating using MNPs for therapeutic applications. Increasing the thermal conversion efficiency of MNPs is the fundamental strategy for improving therapeutic efficacy. Recently, emerging experimental evidence indicates that MNPs-MH produces nano-scale heat effects without macroscopic temperature rise. A deep understanding of the effect of this localized induction heat for the destruction of subcellular/cellular structures further supports the efficacy of MH in improving therapeutic therapy. In this review, the currently available strategies for improving the antitumor therapeutic efficacy of MNPs-MH will be discussed. Firstly, the recent advancements in engineering MNP size, composition, shape, and surface to significantly improve their energy dissipation rates will be explored. Secondly, the latest studies depicting the effect of local induction heat for selectively disrupting cells/intracellular structures will be examined. Thirdly, strategies to enhance the therapeutics by combining MH therapy with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, photothermal/photodynamic therapy (PDT), and gene therapy will be reviewed. Lastly, the prospect and significant challenges in MH-based antitumor therapy will be discussed. This review is to provide a comprehensive understanding of MH for improving antitumor therapeutic efficacy, which would be of utmost benefit towards guiding the users and for the future development of MNPs-MH towards successful application in medicine."
"In vivo pharmacokinetics, transfer and clearance study of graphene oxide by La/Ce dual elemental labelling method","Understanding the pharmacokinetics, distribution, and the behavior underlying the transfer and clearance of graphene oxide (GO) in vivo is critical for its clinical translation. However, GO is a single-atomic layered nanomaterial comprised only of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen molecules, tracking GO in vivo is difficult. In this study, we developed a novel dual-element labelling strategy using the two rare-earth elements lanthanum (La) and cerium (Ce) as tags on polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) modified GO (La/Ce-GO-PVP) to successfully track the bioaccumulation, transfer, and clearance of GO in vivo. The data showed that intravenously injected La/Ce-GO-PVP nanosheets could be rapidly intercepted by the mononuclear phagocyte system rich organs (lung, liver, and spleen) and the kidney. A visual exploration for La/Ce-GO-PVP transfer and clearance in intra-organs and ultrastructure of the organs by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed. The thin, flexible, and well-dispersed GO-PVP was observed to enter into the deep sub-organs of the lung, liver and spleen, pass through the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) of the kidney and was excreted in the urine. In addition, we observed the GO nanosheets by rolling, crumpling or folding their morphology to facilitate their transfer across the continuous, fenestrated, and discontinuous endothelium, where GO can then be transferred and cleared in the intra-organs. This study provides a further understanding for the thin and flexible GO transfer and clearance in vivo, and the interactions with physiological barriers in view of their potential biomedical applications."
Synthesis and Self-Assembly Behavior of Chlorophyll Derivatives for Ratiometric Photoacoustic Signal Optimization,"Self-assembly provides researchers powerful tools for creating ordered functional structures and complex architectures. Investigation of in vivo self-assembly reveals the assembly/aggregation-induced retention (AIR) effect and enhanced targeting effect, which can be applied to promising biomedical applications by enhancing molecular accumulation in the target region. These unique bioeffects inspire the interest of researchers in construction of self-assembled nanomaterials in biological systems. Although many efforts have been achieved, the in-depth analysis of the relationship between assemblies and functions is rarely reported. Here, we focus on the relationship of chlorophyll-derivative assemblies and their photoacoustic signals and attempt to establish a method for monitoring the aggregation efficiency in vivo based on photoacoustic signals. Three arginine-rich peptide-purpurin molecules were designed and synthesized. The assembled capabilities and assembly processes of these molecules were characterized and monitored by UV, fluorescence, and CD spectra images of gradually changing polarities in mixed solvents, and the morphologies of the assemblies were observed by TEM. Furthermore, the relationship between the aggregation ratios of the molecules and the ratiometric photoacoustic signals was systemically studied. We prospect that the fundamental research in revealing objective laws will be useful for future guidance in optimizing photoacoustic detection windows and assembled molecule design."
Assessing the risk of main activities of nanotechnology companies by the NanoTool method,"Purpose. Nanotechnology can be considered one of the greatest developments over the past few decades. Despite many applications of nanomaterials in various fields, there are concerns about their effects on humans and the environment. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the risk level of activities involving nanomaterials in nanotechnology companies in Tehran, Iran. Materials and methods. After identifying the main activities of 18 nanotechnology companies, these activities were assessed using the NanoTool method, which is a method for assessing risks of activities involving nanomaterials. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 22. Results. The results showed that in six activities (33.30%) the risk level was 4 (RL4), in eight activities (44.40%) the risk level was 3 (RL3) and four activities (22.30%) had risk level 2 (RL2). Also, it was found that 78.88% of the controls used by these companies were not enough to reduce the risks of nanomaterials and need to be upgraded. Conclusions. The high level of risk in the activities involving nanomaterials shows that there are serious problems regarding the safety of nanomaterials in the nanotechnology companies in Tehran, Iran."
Augmented interaction of multivalent arginine coated gold nanoclusters with lipid membranes and cells,"A library of ultra-small red photoluminescent gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) were synthesized with an increasing amount of positive charges provided by the addition of mono-, di- or trivalent-glutathione modified arginine peptides. We then studied how the arginine content impacted on the interaction of Au NCs with negatively charged artificial lipid bilayers and cell membranes. Results indicated that increasing the arginine content enhanced Au NCs' adsorption on lipid bilayers and on cell membranes followed by an increased cellular uptake in melanoma cells (COLO 829). Surprisingly, the presence of up to 40% serum for highly positively charged Au NCs did not hinder their interaction with lipid bilayers that contain glycolipids, suggesting a reduced opsonization of these Au NCs. In addition, these Au NCs are usually not toxic, except those with the highest arginine contents. Thus, controlled grafting of arginine peptides onto Au NCs is an elegant strategy to improve their binding and internalization by tumor cells while still keeping their anti-fouling properties."
"Investigation of twenty metal, metal oxide, and metal sulfide nanoparticles' impact on differentiated Caco-2 monolayer integrity","The use of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in foods and consumer products is rising, increasing the potential for unintentional ingestion. While the cytotoxicity of many ENMs has been investigated, less attention has been given to adverse impact on the intestinal barrier integrity. Chronical disruption of gastrointestinal integrity can have far reaching health implications. Using fully differentiated Caco-2 cells, the perturbation of intestinal barrier function and cytotoxicity were investigated for 20 metal, metal oxide, and metal sulfide ENMs. Caco-2 cells were exposed to 50 μg/mL ENMs for 24 h. ENM formulations were characterized at 0 and 24 h, and In Vitro Sedimentation, Diffusion and Dosimetry Modeling was applied to calculate the effective dose of exposure during 24 h. The apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) was determined for fluorescent labeled dextran (3000 Da) and tight junction integrity was evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy. Cytotoxicity was investigated by determining lactate dehydrogenase release (LDH) and cell metabolic activity (tetrazolium based MTS) assays. Four ENMs led to significantly increased Papp, (15.8% w/w% Ag-SiO2 nanoparticle (NP), 60 nm CdS NP, 100 nm V2O5 flakes, and 50 nm ZnO NP), while one ENM (20 nm MgO NP) decreased Papp. With the exception of CdS NP, significantly increased Papp was not connected with cell cytotoxicity. The calculated effective dose concentration was not correlated with increased Papp. Our results illustrate that while many metal, metal oxide, and metal sulfide ENMs do not adversely affect monolayer integrity or induce cytotoxicity in differentiated Caco-2 cells, a subset of ENMs may compromise the intestinal integrity. This study demonstrated the use of differentiated Caco-2 monolayer and Papp as an endpoint to identify and prioritize ENMs that should be investigated further. The interaction between ENMs and the intestinal epithelium needs to be evaluated to understand potential intestinal barrier dysfunction and resulting health implications."
Genotoxicity assessment of carbon-based nanomaterials; Have their unique physicochemical properties made them double-edged swords?,"Carbon-based nanomaterials (CNMs) have attracted a great deal of attention because of their outstanding combinations of physicochemical properties. The unique physicochemical properties of CNMs have made them promising nanomaterials (NMs) for a large number of applications. However, these size-dependent properties serve as a double-edged sword, which makes them fascinating materials with specific features. In particular, some health hazards have been associated with exposure to NMs. Among these hazards, genotoxicity has been the subject of intense research due to its role in inducing cancer-causing inheritable mutations. High reactivity, agglomeration tendency, and a high surface-to-volume ratio of CNMs make their interactions with biological moieties unknown, complicated, and multifactorial-dependent. In this regard, the genotoxicity of each part of the CNMs family must be evaluated and considered together with other parameters. Because of the increasing application of CNMs in everyday goods and products, as well as the growth in the potential exposure of humans to CNMs, there is a critical need to assess the genotoxic potential of each part of the CNMs family. Therefore, the main objective of this review is to provide an overview of the potential genotoxicity of CNMs and explore risk assessment strategies to quickly screen and assess emerging CNMs. It is critical to pay equal attention to both nongenotoxic and genotoxic CNMs, because some CNMs identified as nongenotoxic NMs may promote or aid the progression of the tumors."
Monomer-targeting affinity peptide inhibitors of amyloid with no self-fibrillation and low cytotoxicity,We utilized solution-phase biopanning to obtain a de novo peptide (LA12) that specifically bound to the core region of the human amylin monomer. LA12 stabilized the random coil conformation of amylin to suppress aggregation in a dose-dependent manner with the highest suppression effect of 78% and reduced the cytotoxicity of amylin.
Isothermal kinase-triggered supramolecular assemblies as drug sensitizers,"Protein kinases, the main regulators of a vast map of cellular processes, are the most attractive targets in drug discovery. Despite a few successful examples of protein kinase inhibitors, the drug discovery strategy of downregulating protein kinase activity has been quite limited and often fails even in animal models. Here, we utilize protein kinase A (PKA) activity to design PKA-triggered supramolecular assemblies with anticancer activities. Grafting a suitable peptide to PNIPAM raises the critical temperature of the LCST polymer above body temperature. Interestingly, the corresponding phosphorylated polymer has a critical temperature below body temperature, making this peptide-appended PNIPAM a suitable polymer for the PKA-triggered supramolecular assembly process. PKA-triggered assembly occurs selectively in PKA-upregulated MCF-7 cells, which disturbs the cytoskeleton and sensitizes cancer cells against doxorubicin. The chemosensitization is also observed in vivo to identify effective tumor inhibitors with satisfactory biocompatibility. Overall, this phosphorylation-induced (in principle, PKA-catalyzed) supramolecular assembly opens up a promising chemotherapy strategy for combating kinase-upregulated cancer."
Surface chemistry of gold nanoparticles for health-related applications,"Functionalization of gold nanoparticles is crucial for the effective utilization of these materials in health-related applications. Health-related applications of gold nanoparticles rely on the physical and chemical reactions between molecules and gold nanoparticles. Surface chemistry can precisely control and tailor the surface properties of gold nanoparticles to meet the needs of applications. Gold nanoparticles have unique physical and chemical properties, and have been used in a broad range of applications from prophylaxis to diagnosis and treatment. The surface chemistry of gold nanoparticles plays a crucial role in all of these applications. This minireview summarizes these applications from the perspective of surface chemistry and explores how surface chemistry improves and imparts new properties to gold nanoparticles for these applications."
Prediction of protein corona on nanomaterials by machine learning using novel descriptors,"Effective in silico methods to predict protein corona compositions on engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) could help elucidate the biological outcomes of ENMs in biosystems without the need for conducting lengthy experiments for corona characterization. However, the physicochemical properties of ENMs, used as the descriptors in current modeling methods, are insufficient to represent the complex interactions between ENMs and proteins. Herein, we utilized the fluorescence change (FC) from fluorescamine labeling on a protein, with or without the presence of the ENM, as a novel descriptor of the ENM to build machine learning models for corona formation. FCs were significantly correlated with the abundance of the corresponding proteins in the corona on diverse classes of ENMs, including metal and metal oxides, nanocellulose, and 2D ENMs. Prediction models established by the random forest algorithm using FCs as the ENM descriptors showed better performance than the conventional descriptors, such as ENM size and surface charge, in the prediction of corona formation. Moreover, they were able to predict protein corona formation on ENMs with very heterogeneous properties. We believe this novel descriptor can improve in silico studies of corona formation, leading to a better understanding on the protein adsorption behaviors of diverse ENMs in different biological matrices. Such information is essential for gaining a comprehensive view of how ENMs interact with biological systems in ENM safety and sustainability assessments."
Impact of magnetic immobilization on the cell physiology of green unicellular algae Chlorella vulgaris,"Cell immobilization on the magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and magnetic harvesting is a novel approach for microalgal cells separation. To date, the effect of these nanoparticles on microalgal cells was only studied over a short period of time. More studies are hence needed for a better understanding of the magnetic harvesting proposes or environmental concerns relating to long-term exposure to nanoparticles. In this study, the impact of various concentrations of MNPs on the microalgal cells growth and their metabolic status was investigated over 12 days. More than 60% reduction in mitochondrial activity and pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids) content occurred during the first 6 days of exposure to ≥50 µg/mL nanoparticles. However, more than 50% growth inhibitory effect was seen at concentrations higher than 400 µg/mL. Exposure to MNPs gradually induced cellular adaptation and after about 6 days of exposure to stress generating concentrations (˂400 µg/mL) of IONs, microalgae could overcome the imposed damages. This work provides a better understanding regarding the environmental impact of MNPs and appropriate concentrations of these particles for future algal cells magnetic immobilization and harvesting."
A Bi<inf>2</inf>S<inf>3</inf>@mSiO<inf>2</inf>@Ag nanocomposite for enhanced CT visualization and antibacterial response in the gastrointestinal tract,"The non-invasive imaging of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is highly desired for clinical research due to the various GI tract bacterial infection-induced diseases. To treat GI tract infections, various antibiotics have been used in the clinic. The growing problem of multidrug-resistant bacteria calls for effective antibiotic alternatives. Here, we construct a dual-functional Bi2S3@mSiO2@Ag nanocomposite for simultaneous enhanced X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging and efficient antibacterial activity in the GI tract. The nanocomposite also has good stability, low cytotoxicity, and negligible hemolysis. Moreover, the investigation of the long-Term toxicity and biodistribution of the Bi2S3@mSiO2@Ag nanocomposite after oral administration confirms its safety at the tested dosage. In particular, Ag nanoparticles (NPs) well dispersed on a silica substrate can reduce the antibacterial dosage and enhance the antibacterial activity of the Bi2S3@mSiO2@Ag nanocomposite. Furthermore, we have established bacterially infected enteritis animal models to confirm the antibacterial ability of the nanocomposite. This work opens up a new avenue for the design of a nanotheranostic agent that acts as both a contrast agent for the enhanced visualization of the GI tract and an antibacterial agent as an alternative to antibiotics."
Harmonizing across environmental nanomaterial testing media for increased comparability of nanomaterial datasets,"The chemical composition and properties of environmental media determine nanomaterial (NM) transport, fate, biouptake, and organism response. To compare and interpret experimental data, it is essential that sufficient context be provided for describing the physical and chemical characteristics of the setting in which a nanomaterial may be present. While the nanomaterial environmental, health and safety (NanoEHS) field has begun harmonization to allow data comparison and re-use (e.g. using standardized materials, defining a minimum set of required material characterizations), there is limited guidance for standardizing test media. Since most of the NM properties driving environmental behaviour and toxicity are medium-dependent, harmonization of media is critical. A workshop in March 2016 at Duke University identified five categories of test media: aquatic testing media, soil and sediment testing media, biological testing media, engineered systems testing media and product matrix testing media. For each category of test media, a minimum set of medium characteristics to report in all NM tests is recommended. Definitions and detail level of the recommendations for specific standardized media vary across these media categories. This reflects the variation in the maturity of their use as a test medium and associated measurement techniques, variation in utility and relevance of standardizing medium properties, ability to simplify standardizing reporting requirements, and in the availability of established standard reference media. Adoption of these media harmonization recommendations will facilitate the generation of integrated comparable datasets on NM fate and effects. This will in turn allow testing of the predictive utility of functional assay measurements on NMs in relevant media, support investigation of first principles approaches to understand behavioral mechanisms, and support categorization strategies to guide research, commercial development, and policy."
Photo/thermo-responsive and size-switchable nanoparticles for chemo-photothermal therapy against orthotopic breast cancer,"Tumor penetration of nanocarriers is still an unresolved challenge for effective drug delivery. Herein, we described a size-switchable nanoplatform in response to an external near-infrared (NIR) laser for transcellular drug delivery. The nanoplatform was constructed with a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM)-based nanogel encapsulating chitosan-coated single-walled carbon nanotubes, followed by loading a chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin (DOX). In mice bearing orthotopic breast tumors, the photothermal effect from single-walled carbon nanotubes upon NIR irradiation potently inhibited tumor growth. The antitumor effect of the nanomedicine with NIR irradiation might be attributed to its capability of transcellular transport and tumor penetration in mice. In addition, the nanomedicine with NIR irradiation could elicit an antitumor response by increasing cytotoxic T cells and decreasing myeloid-derived suppressor cells. These results validated the application of photo/thermo-responsive nanomedicine in the orthotopic model of breast cancer."
Preface,
Practices and trends of machine learning application in nanotoxicology,"Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been applied in the field of nanotoxicology with very encouraging results. Adverse effects of nanoforms are affected by multiple features described by theoretical descriptors, nano-specific measured properties, and experimental conditions. ML has been proven very helpful in this field in order to gain an insight into features effecting toxicity, predicting possible adverse effects as part of proactive risk analysis, and informing safe design. At this juncture, it is important to document and categorize the work that has been carried out. This study investigates and bookmarks ML methodologies used to predict nano (eco)-toxicological outcomes in nanotoxicology during the last decade. It provides a review of the sequenced steps involved in implementing an ML model, from data pre-processing, to model implementation, model validation, and applicability domain. The review gathers and presents the step-wise information on techniques and procedures of existing models that can be used readily to assemble new nanotoxicological in silico studies and accelerates the regulation of in silico tools in nanotoxicology. ML applications in nanotoxicology comprise an active and diverse collection of ongoing efforts, although it is still in their early steps toward a scientific accord, subsequent guidelines, and regulation adoption. This study is an important bookend to a decade of ML applications to nanotoxicology and serves as a useful guide to further in silico applications."

Two-dimensional nanomaterials beyond graphene for antibacterial applications: Current progress and future perspectives,"The marked augment of drug-resistance to traditional antibiotics underlines the crying need for novel replaceable antibacterials. Research advances have revealed the considerable sterilization potential of two-dimension graphene-based nanomaterials. Subsequently, two-dimensional nanomaterials beyond graphene (2D NBG) as novel antibacterials have also demonstrated their power for disinfection due to their unique physicochemical properties and good biocompatibility. Therefore, the exploration of antibacterial mechanisms of 2D NBG is vital to manipulate antibacterials for future applications. Herein, we summarize the recent research progress of 2D NBG-based antibacterial agents, starting with a detailed introduction of the relevant antibacterial mechanisms, including direct contact destruction, oxidative stress, photo-induced antibacterial, control drug/metallic ions releasing, and the multi-mode synergistic antibacterial. Then, the effect of the physicochemical properties of 2D NBG on their antibacterial activities is also discussed. Additionally, a summary of the different kinds of 2D NBG is given, such as transition-metal dichalcogenides/oxides, metal-based compounds, nitride-based nanomaterials, black phosphorus, transition metal carbides, and nitrides. Finally, we rationally analyze the current challenges and new perspectives for future study of more effective antibacterial agents. This review not only can help researchers grasp the current status of 2D NBG antibacterials, but also may catalyze breakthroughs in this fast-growing field."
RNA nanotechnology-mediated cancer immunotherapy,"RNA molecules (e.g., siRNA, microRNA, and mRNA) have shown tremendous potential for immunomodulation and cancer immunotherapy. They can activate both innate and adaptive immune system responses by silencing or upregulating immune-relevant genes. In addition, mRNA-based vaccines have recently been actively pursued and tested in cancer patients, as a form of treatment. Meanwhile, various nanomaterials have been developed to enhance RNA delivery to the tumor and immune cells. In this review article, we summarize recent advances in the development of RNA-based therapeutics and their applications in cancer immunotherapy. We also highlight the variety of nanoparticle platforms that have been used for RNA delivery to elicit anti-tumor immune responses. Finally, we provide our perspectives of potential challenges and opportunities of RNA-based nanotherapeutics in clinical translation towards cancer immunotherapy."
Non-lamellar liquid crystalline nanocarriers for thymoquinone encapsulation,"Owing to their unique structural features, non-lamellar liquid crystalline nanoparticles comprising cubosomes and hexosomes are attracting increasing attention as versatile investigative drug carriers. Background: Depending on their physiochemical characteristics, drug molecules on entrapment can modulate and reorganize structural features of cubosomes and hexosomes. Therefore, it is important to assess the effect of guest molecules on broader biophysical characteristics of non-lamellar liquid crystalline nanoparticles, since drug-induced architectural, morphological, and size modifications can affect the biological performance of cubosomes and hexosomes. Methods: We report on alterations in morphological, structural, and size characteristics of nanodispersions composed from binary mixtures of glycerol monooleate and vitamin E on thymoquinone (a molecule with wide therapeutic potentials) loading. Results: Thymoquinone loading was associated with a slight increase in the mean hydrodynamic nanoparticle size and led to structural transitions from an internal biphasic feature of coexisting inverse cubic Fd3m and hexagonal (H2) phases to an internal inverse cubic Fd3m phase (micellar cubosomes) or an internal inverse micellar (L2) phase (emulsified microemulsions, EMEs). We further report on the presence of ""flower-like"" vesicular populations in both native and drug-loaded nanodispersions. Conclusions: These nanodispersions have the potential to accommodate thymoquinone and may be considered as promising platforms for the development of thymoquinone nanomedicines."
Engineered metal oxide nanomaterials inhibit corneal epithelial wound healing in vitro and in vivo,"Ocular exposure to metal oxide engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) is common as exemplified by zinc(II) oxide (ZnO), a major constituent of sunscreens and cosmetics. The ocular surface that includes the transparent cornea and its protective tear film are common sites of exposure for metal ENMs. Despite the frequency of exposure of the ocular surface, there is a knowledge gap regarding the effects of metal oxide ENMs on the cornea in health and disease. Therefore, we studied the effects of metal oxide ENMs on the cornea in the presence or absence of injury. Cell viability of immortalized human corneal epithelial (hTCEpi) cells was assessed following treatment with 11 metal oxide ENMs with a concentration ranging from 0.5 to 250 μg/ml for 24 h. An epithelial wound healing assay with a monolayer of hTCEpi cells was then performed using 11 metal oxide ENMs at select concentrations based on data from the viability assays. Subsequently, based on the in vitro results, in vivo testing of precorneal tear film (PTF) quantity and stability as well as a corneal epithelial wound healing were tested in the presence or absence ZnO or vanadium(V) oxide (V2O5) at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. We found that WO3, ZnO, V2O5 and CuO ENMs significantly reduced hTCEpi cell viability in comparison to vehicle control or the other metal oxide ENMs tested. Furthermore, ZnO and V2O5 ENMs also significantly decreased hTCEpi cell migration. Although ZnO and V2O5 did not alter PTF parameters of rabbits in vivo, corneal epithelial wound healing was significantly delayed by topical ZnO while V2O5 did not alter wound healing. Finally, hyperspectral images confirmed penetration of ZnO and V2O5 through all corneal layers and into the iris stroma. Considering the marked epithelial toxicity and corneal penetration of ZnO, further investigations on the impact of this ENM on the eye are warranted."
Synthesis of precision gold nanoparticles using Turkevich method,"Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) exhibit unique size-dependent physiochemical properties that make them attractive for a wide range of applications. However, the large-scale availability of precision AuNPs has been minimal. Not only must the required nanoparticles be of precise size and morphology, but they must also be of exceedingly narrow size distribution to yield accurate and reliable performance. The present study aims to synthesize precision AuNPs and to assess the advantages and limitations of the Turkevich method—one of the common chemical synthesis technique. Colloidal AuNPs from 15 nm to 50 nm in diameter were synthesized using the Turkevich method. The effect of the molar ratio of the reagent mixture (trisodium citrate to gold chloride), the scaled-up batch size, the initial gold chloride concentration, and the reaction temperature was studied. The morphology, optical property, surface chemistry, and chemical composition of AuNPs were thoroughly characterized. It was determined that the as-synthesized AuNPs between 15 nm and 30 nm exhibit well-defined size and shape, and narrow size distribution (PDI < 0.20). However, the AuNPs became more polydispersed and less spherical in shape as the particle size increased."
Engineered Nanoplatelets for Targeted Delivery of Plasminogen Activators to Reverse Thrombus in Multiple Mouse Thrombosis Models,"Rapid cut-off of blood supply in diseases involving thrombosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, the current thrombolysis strategies offer limited results due to the therapeutics' short half-lives, low targeting ability, and unexpected bleeding complications. Inspired by the innate roles of platelets in hemostasis and pathological thrombus, platelet membrane-camouflaged polymeric nanoparticles (nanoplatelets) are developed for targeting delivery of the thrombolytic drug, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), to local thrombus sites. The tailor-designed nanoplatelets efficiently accumulate at the thrombi in pulmonary embolism and mesenteric arterial thrombosis model mice, eliciting a significantly enhanced thrombolysis activity compared to free rt-PA. In addition, the nanoplatelets exhibit improved therapeutic efficacy over free rt-PA in an ischemic stroke model. Analysis of in vivo coagulation indicators suggests the nanoplatelets might possess a low risk of bleeding complications. The hybrid biomimetic nanoplatelets described offer a promising solution to improve the efficacy and reduce the bleeding risk of thrombolytic therapy in a broad spectrum of thrombosis diseases."
A Bioinspired Nanoprobe with Multilevel Responsive T<inf>1</inf>-Weighted MR Signal-Amplification Illuminates Ultrasmall Metastases,"Metastasis remains the major cause of death in cancer patients. Thus, there is a need to sensitively detect tumor metastasis, especially ultrasmall metastasis, for early diagnosis and precise treatment of cancer. Herein, an ultrasensitive T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent, UMFNP-CREKA is reported. By conjugating the ultrasmall manganese ferrite nanoparticles (UMFNPs) with a tumor-targeting penta-peptide CREKA (Cys-Arg-Glu-Lys-Ala), ultrasmall breast cancer metastases are accurately detected. With a behavior similar to neutrophils' immunosurveillance process for eliminating foreign pathogens, UMFNP-CREKA exhibits a chemotactic “targeting-activation” capacity. UMFNP-CREKA is recruited to the margin of tumor metastases by the binding of CREKA with fibrin-fibronectin complexes, which are abundant around tumors, and then release of manganese ions (Mn2+) to the metastasis in response to pathological parameters (mild acidity and elevated H2O2). The localized release of Mn2+ and its interaction with proteins affects a marked amplification of T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) signals. In vivo T1-weighted MRI experiments reveal that UMFNP-CREKA can detect metastases at an unprecedented minimum detection limit of 0.39 mm, which has significantly extended the detection limit of previously reported MRI probe."
Smart calcium peroxide with self-sufficience for biomedicine,
Subvisible Particles in IVIg Formulations Activate Complement in Human Serum,"When administered intravenously, various particles and nanomedicines activate complement, potentially leading to infusion reactions and other adverse drug reactions. Particles form within formulations of therapeutic proteins due to stresses incurred during shipping, handling, and administration to patients. In this study, IVIg solutions were stored in multiple types of vials and prefilled syringes and exposed to agitation and freeze-thaw stresses to generate particles. The stressed samples were added to human serum to determine whether these particles activated complement. Subvisible IVIg particles ranging in size between 2 and 10 microns activated complement in a fashion that was linearly dependent on the number of particles dosed, whereas little correlation was found between doses of larger particles (>10 microns) and complement activation. Activation of complement by subvisible particles of IVIg followed the alternative pathway, as shown by the release of complement cascade factor Bb and the production of the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a without generation of C4a. The number and the morphology of subvisible particles formed depended on the applied stress, formulation, and on the container material. But the capacity of the 2- to 10-micron-sized particles to activate complement in human serum appeared to depend only on particle concentration."
Synchrotron-based techniques for studying the environmental health effects of heavy metals: Current status and future perspectives,"This review summarizes the state-of-the-art synchrotron-based techniques for studying the environmental health effects of heavy metals exposure. Synchrotron radiation based X-ray fluorescence (SRXRF) is widely applied in quantification of metals in different biological and environmental samples. X-ray absorption spectrometry (XAS) is used for speciation of heavy metals. With high energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) XAS, it is possible to study heavy metals in biological samples at realistic concentrations. The focused synchrotron-based X-ray is applied to image metals down to nm resolution at 2- or 3- dimension (2D or 3D). The combination of XAS with SRXRF can realize 2D or 3D spatial speciation, along with other techniques like scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and full field XAS. The structure of metal-binding biomolecules can be characterized by Protein X-ray Diffraction (PX) and/or XAS, together with neutron scattering. The future aspects of multimode detection, new imaging methods, fast detector technologies and big data strategies in synchrotron-based techniques were also discussed."
Bacteria-Instructed In Situ Aggregation of AuNPs with Enhanced Photoacoustic Signal for Bacterial Infection Bioimaging,"The emergence of drug-resistant bacteria is becoming the focus of global public health. Early-stage pathogen bioimaging will offer a unique perspective to obtain infection information in patients. A photoacoustic (PA) contrast agent based on functional peptide modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs@P1) is developed. These nanoparticles can be specifically tailored surface peptides by bacterial overexpressed enzyme inducing in situ aggregation of the gold nanoparticles. In the meantime, the close aggregation based on the hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking, and hydrophobic interaction of the peptide residues on the surface of gold nanoparticles exhibits a typical redshifted and broadened plasmon band. In addition, this active targeting and following in situ stimuli-induced aggregation contribute to increased nanoparticle accumulation in the infected site. Finally, the dynamic aggregation of AuNPs@P1 results in dramatically enhanced photoacoustic signals for bioimaging bacterial infection in vivo with high sensitivity and specificity. It is envisioned that this PA contrast agent may provide a new approach for early detection of bacterial infection in vivo."
Analysis of salivary exosomal proteins in young adults with severe periodontitis,"Objectives: Salivary exosomes harbour numerous constituents associated with oral and systemic diseases. However, no reports addressed components of salivary exosomes in patients with periodontitis. Our study aims to explore salivary exosomal proteins in young adults with severe periodontitis (SP) and to analyse the relationships between different proteins. Materials and Methods: We collected saliva from 11 young adults with SP and 11 periodontally healthy subjects. After isolation of salivary exosomes, liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to analyse proteins. Gene ontology analysis was performed based on GeneCodis, and interaction network analysis for unique salivary exosomal proteins was performed by STRING. Results: Twenty-six proteins were identified only in the SP group, and 58 proteins were identified only in the healthy group. Gene ontology analysis revealed that innate immune response, cytolysis and complement activation were highly enriched in the SP group. Interaction network analysis showed that the correlations among immune-related proteins (e.g. complement components and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 28) were significant in the SP group. C6 proteins expressed only in the SP group were evaluated by Western blotting. Conclusions: Salivary exosomes from periodontitis patients are enriched immune-related proteins that might participate in the immune response during the development of periodontitis."
Time-resolved characterization of the mechanisms of toxicity induced by silica and amino-modified polystyrene on alveolar-like macrophages,"Macrophages play a major role in the removal of foreign materials, including nano-sized materials, such as nanomedicines and other nanoparticles, which they accumulate very efficiently. Because of this, it is recognized that for a safe development of nanotechnologies and nanomedicine, it is essential to investigate potential effects induced by nano-sized materials on macrophages. To this aim, in this work, a recently established model of primary murine alveolar-like macrophages was used to investigate macrophage responses to two well-known nanoparticle models: 50 nm amino-modified polystyrene, known to induce cell death via lysosomal damage and apoptosis in different cell types, and 50 nm silica nanoparticles, which are generally considered non-toxic. Then, a time-resolved study was performed to characterize in detail the response of the macrophages following exposure to the two nanoparticles. As expected, exposure to the amino-modified polystyrene led to cell death, but surprisingly no lysosomal swelling or apoptosis were detected. On the contrary, a peculiar mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization was observed, accompanied by endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress), increased cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and changes of metabolic activity, ultimately leading to cell death. Strong toxic responses were observed also after exposure to silica, which included mitochondrial ROS production, mitochondrial depolarization and cell death by apoptosis. Overall, these results showed that exposure to the two nanoparticles led to a very different series of intracellular events, suggesting that the macrophages responded differently to the two nanoparticle models. Similar time-resolved studies are required to characterize the response of macrophages to nanoparticles, as a key parameter in nanosafety assessment."
Mitochondria-Targeted Nanoscale MOFs for Improved Photodynamic Therapy,"Due to the existence of hypoxic microenvironment, the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) is frequently weakened. As a result, targeted treatment toward oxygen-rich mitochondria is considered as a promising cancer therapy. Herein, both triphenylphosphine (TPP) and folic acid (FA) are simultaneously grafted onto nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (NMOFs) to realize dual-targeting delivery of the nanoplatforms into cancer cells and their mitochondria via the proposed phosphorylation modification strategy. A large amount of highly efficient photosensitizer of porphyrinic molecules is integrated into the NMOFs with a uniform particle size of about 65 nm. Thanks to the strong Zr−O−P bonding, a dense coverage of phosphonate-conjugating targeting molecules on NMOFs is obtained and each surficial unsaturated Zr−O cluster is adequately occupied. The resultant dual-targeting NMOFs feature high biostability and biocompatibility, as well as improved cellular uptake and mitochondrial accumulation. The PDT efficacy of these dual-targeting NMOFs is significantly improved with a low IC50 of 0.74 μM upon 10 min light radiation, which is at least four times higher than that of non-targeting counterparts. This phosphorylation strategy would be hopeful for immobilizing a variety of biogenic groups on NMOFs to make them targetable to various specific organelles and to improve the therapy efficacy on related diseases."
The unique regulation of implant surface nanostructure on macrophages M1 polarization,"The inflammatory response is the first and inevitable event after implant surgery in vivo, in which the macrophages M1 polarization is mediated. Numerous publications indicate that the physical properties of implant surface nanostructure can influence macrophages M1 polarization status, whereas the regulation mechanisms have not been elucidated yet. Unlike the conventional biochemical factors that can directly bind to the cellular surface receptors or be transported into cytoplasm, the physical information of implant surface nanostructure can only be sensed by direct contact with cells. Therefore, we infer that the implant surface nanostructure may have unique regulation mechanisms. In this study, we compared the influences of the titanium implant surface coated with titania nanotubes on the surface (∼100 nm diameter, NT-100) and the standard IFN-γ/LPS stimulation on the macrophages M1 polarization. Both the NT-100 surface and IFN-γ/LPS stimulation could induce macrophages M1 polarization, indicated by significant upregulation of M1-specific molecules including CD86, iNOS, CCR7 and IL-1β, without affecting the M2-specific molecules including CD206, Arg1 and IL-10. However, we found that the IFN-γ/LPS induced macrophages M1 polarization was mediated by RBP-J-IRF8 pathway, whereas the NT-100 surface was more related to FAK-MAPKs pathway, particularly the JNK and ERK1/2 signaling. Our study demonstrated that the implant surface nanostructure has great potential to trigger the host inflammatory response through distinct pathways from conventional biochemical factors, which may remind us to re-consider the unique regulation mechanisms of nano surface on cell functions. Our finding offers a theoretical basis for titanium implant modification to benefit tissue integration."
