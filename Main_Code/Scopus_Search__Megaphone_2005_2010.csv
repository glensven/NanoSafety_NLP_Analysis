2010-12-01,Reinventing Thailand: Thaksin and his foreign policy,"From 2001 to 2006, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra transformed Thailand's international role from one of obscurity into a kind of regional hegemon. Thaksin's diplomatic ambitions were reflected in his myriad of grandiose foreign policy initiatives, designed to locate Thailand at the forefront of regional politics and reinstall the Thai sphere of influence over weaker neighbouring states. He abolished the traditional bending-with-the-wind foreign policy, revamped the Thai Foreign Ministry, and empowered Thai envoys through the CEO Ambassadors programme. But in this process, Thaksin was accused of exploiting foreign policy to enrich his business empire. Thaksin's reinvention of Thailand as an up-and-coming regional power was therefore tainted by conflicts of interest and the absence of ethical principles in the country's foreign policy. © 2010 Institute of Southeast Asian Studies.

2010-12-01,The Wars of the Roses,"The Wars of the Roses (1455-85) were a major turning point in English history. But the underlying causes for the successive upheavals have been hotly contested by historians ever since. In this original and stimulating new synthesis, distinguished historian Michael Hicks examines the difficult economic, military, and financial crises and explains, for the first time, the real reasons why the Wars of the Roses began, why they kept recurring, and why, eventually, they ceased. Alongside fresh assessments of key personalities, Hicks sheds new light on the significance of the involvement of the people in politics, the intervention of foreign powers in English affairs, and a fifteenth-century credit crunch. Combining a meticulous dissection of competing dynamics with a clear account of the course of events, this is a definitive and indispensable history of a compelling, complex period. © 2010 Michael Hicks.

2010-12-01,Social media and customer dialog management at Starbucks,"While listening to and learning from customers has long been recognized as important, social media are fundamentally changing interaction between firms and customers. To help understand this changing interaction, we conceptualize customer dialog management in a Megaphone, Magnet, and Monitor (3-M) framework, with the Megaphone representing firm-to-customer communication, the Magnet customer-to-firm, communication and the Monitor customer-to-customer interaction. This framework provides a structure for understanding the opportunities and risks presented by social media. We describe an in-depth case study of Starbucks, a firm widely regarded as a leader in corporate use of social media. Using the 3-M framework, we identify the challenges social media introduce and offer case-based examples of how to manage these challenges. Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines that can assist firms in navigating the evolving environment of social-media-based customer dialog. © 2010 University of Minnesota."
2010-11-01,"Availability of body art facilities and body art piercing do not predict hepatitis C acquisition among injection drug users in Montreal, Canada: Results from a cohort study","Background: Cross-sectional associations suggest that body art piercing (BAP) is a risk factor for hepatitis C (HCV) infection among injection drug users. The temporal basis of the relationship has not been established. Methods: Associations between HCV seropositivity, HCV incidence, recent BAP and BAP facility availability were evaluated among IDUs followed biannually between 2004 and 2008 in Montreal, Canada. A geographic information system was used to determine the availability of BAP facilities for each participant. Statistical models included individual and neighbourhood covariates. Logistic regression was used for analysis of HCV seropositivity. Cox proportional hazards regression was used for analysis of HCV incidence. Results: Of 784 IDUs, 73% were seropositive for HCV. In multivariable logistic regression, HCV seropositivity was associated with BAP availability (OR: 1.32 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 1.6) but not recent BAP. Of 145 initially HCV-negative participants, 52 seroconverted to HCV for an incidence of 27.7/100 person-years (95%CI: 20.9, 36.0). Crude hazard ratios (HR) for the association between HCV infection and BAP variables were: recent BAP, HR 0.98 (95%CI: 0.4, 2.7) and BAP facilities availability, HR 1.43 (95%CI: 1.1, 1.9). After accounting for individual and neighbourhood factors, crude associations between HCV infection and recent BAP and BAP facilities availability were: HR recent BAP, 0.96, 95%CI: 0.3, 2.7; and HR BAP facility availability, 1.21, 95%CI: 0.9, 1.7. Conclusion: BAP facility availability is a marker of neighbourhood disadvantage associated with HCV seropositivity. Longitudinal analyses accounting for behaviour risk factors and neighbourhood characteristics do not support a temporal association between BAP acquisition, BAP facility availability, and HCV infection among IDUs. © 2010 Elsevier B.V."
2010-09-01,"From the Simpsons to ""The Simpsons of the South Pacific"": New Zealand's first primetime animation, bro'Town","New Zealand's first primetime animated program, bro'Town, ran successfully for five seasons between 2004 and 2009. Described by its creators as a ""modern-day non-PC satire,"" bro'Town focuses on five New Zealand teenagers of Samoan and Maori ethnicities growing up in Auckland. While the program was promoted as ""The Simpsons of the South Pacific,"" its audience, critics, and politicians have celebrated it as a twenty-first-century New Zealand creative success story. This article explores the historical, cultural, and economic forces that have shaped bro'Town in the context of the debates on media globalization using the framework of hybridity as ""the cultural logic of globalization"" as well as the framework of global television formats. The authors suggest that bro'Town represents a complex case of television program adaptation and provides a unique case study to examine the multilayered nature of contemporary hybrid cultural forms moving beyond the simplistic local-global dyad. © 2010 SAGE Publications."

2010-07-16,"Megaphone: Fault tolerant, scalable, and trustworthy P2P microblogging","Micro-blogging, or the posting of weblogs entries that have a small number of characters (160 characters or less), has recently become more mainstream. Services that implement micro-blogging such as Twitter are usually based on the clientserver model. This limits their scalability and fault tolerance. In this paper, we present a new secure microblogging system that is based on a peer-to-peer network. The network is arranged based on user certificates and is scalable, does not have a single point of failure, and does not depend on a single vendor's proprietary service. The paper outlines the protocol specifics and provides implementation details for a secure, scaleable microblogging system. © 2010 IEEE."

However, little research, especially in Europe, has been done so far exploring how NPOs are actually taking advantage of this. This study analyzes how charitable fundraising NPOs in Germany and Switzerland employ their Web sites for dialogic communication with donors and media. Results indicate that NPOs provide well-designed Web sites, yet, fail to engage publics in dialogue. New trends, such as Web 2.0, are still hardly taken into account. Whereas donor publics are often addressed, media are often neglected. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
2010-07-01,"Associations among park use, age, social participation, and neighborhood age composition in Montreal","Parks provide benefits for the physical, psychological, and social well-being of residents in neighborhood environments.Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine associations between neighborhood- and individual-level characteristics and the lack of park use in Montreal. Data on park use were collected from 787 adults residing in 299 different neighborhoods. Results found that older adults who lived in areas with a younger age composition were more likely not to use their nearby parks as compared to older adults living in areas with an older age composition. Forms of social participation were also important for the park use of older adults. Public policies should consider targeting aspects of the social environment to improve neighborhood park use. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
2010-07-01,Social Inequalities in Food Exposure Around Schools in an Urban Area,"Background: The obesity epidemic among children and youth, and the social gradient in this relationship, could be related to differential exposure to food sources in primary environments. Although the positive association between area-level deprivation and fast-food outlets offering high-calorie foods has been well documented, few studies have evaluated food sources around school settings. Purpose: This study evaluated the relationships among food sources around schools, neighborhood income, and commercial density. Methods: A GIS was used to derive measures of exposure to fast-food outlets, fruit and vegetable stores, and full-service restaurants near primary and secondary schools in Montreal, Canada, in 2005. Food source availability was analyzed in 2009 in relation to neighborhood income for the area around schools, accounting for commercial density. Results: For the 1168 schools identified, strong neighborhood income gradients were observed in relation to food sources. Relative to the highest income-quartile schools, the odds of a fast-food outlet being located within 750 m of a low income-quartile school was 30.9 (95% CI=19.6, 48.9). Similar relationships were observed for full-service restaurants (OR=77, 95% CI=35, 169.3) and fruit and vegetable stores (OR=29.6, 95% CI=18.8, 46.7). These associations were reduced, but remained significant in models accounting for commercial density. Conclusions: Food source exposure around schools is inversely associated with neighborhood income, but commercial density partly accounts for this association. Further research is necessary to document food consumption among youth attending schools in relation to nearby food source opportunities. © 2010 American Journal of Preventive Medicine."
2010-06-15,"Design, synthesis, and docking of highly hypolipidemic agents: Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a new model for evaluating α-asarone-based HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors","A series of α-asarone-based analogues was designed by conducting docking experiments with published crystal structures of human HMG-CoA reductase. Indeed, synthesis and evaluation of this series showed a highly hypocholesterolemic in vivo activity in a murine model, as predicted by previous docking studies. In agreement with this model, the polar groups attached to the benzene ring could play a key role in the enzyme binding and probably also in its biological activity, mimicking the HMG-moiety of the natural substrate. The hypolipidemic action mechanism of these compounds was investigated by developing a simple, efficient, and novel model for determining HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. The partial purification of the enzyme from Schizosaccharomyces pombe allowed for testing of α-asarone- and fibrate-based analogues, resulting in positive and significant inhibitory activity. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

2010-06-02,"Nimo's war, Emma's war: Making feminist sense of the Iraq War","Nimo, Maha, Safah, Shatha, Emma, Danielle, Kim, Charlene. In a book that once again blends her distinctive flair for capturing the texture of everyday life with shrewd political insights, Cynthia Enloe looks closely at the lives of eight ordinary women, four Iraqis and four Americans, during the Iraq War. Among others, Enloe profiles a Baghdad beauty parlor owner, a teenage girl who survived a massacre, an elected member of Parliament, the young wife of an Army sergeant, and an African American woman soldier. Each chapter begins with a close-up look at one woman's experiences and widens into a dazzling examination of the larger canvas of war's gendered dimensions. Bringing to light hidden and unexpected theaters of operation-prostitution, sexual assault, marriage, ethnic politics, sexist economies-these stories are a brilliant entryway into an eye-opening exploration of the actual causes, costs, and long-range consequences of war. This unique comparison of American and Iraqi women's diverse and complex experiences sheds a powerful light on the different realities that together we call, perhaps too easily, ""the Iraq war."" © 2010 by The Regents of the University of California."
2010-06-01,'The spirit of local patriotism': Progress and populism in Sydney's northern suburbs in the 1920s,"Local patriotism emerged in Australia in the suburbs from the mid nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, influenced by progressivism, it was a populist reaction by emerging suburbs and municipalities to state power and the political and cultural dominance of the city. Promoting the local as the anchor for a chain of national and imperial being and the place where moral capital was renewed, local patriotism paradoxically elevated ties of community and locality above all else. It also exhibited a 'reactionary modernism' which embraced new technology while seeking to maintain traditional values linked to the land and a British inheritance. Ultimately, self-interest - driven by exclusivism, anti-urbanism and class quarantining - underpinned local patriotism in Australia. Although its currency was relatively short-lived, it remained persuasive in Australian political culture. This article examines local patriotism through a case study of Sydney's North Shore and northern suburbs in the first three decades of the twentieth century, drawing extensively on a local newspaper, The Suburban Herald. © 2010 International Australian Studies Association."

2010-03-01,Interactive effects of reward sensitivity and residential fast-food restaurant exposure on fast-food consumption,"Background: Local fast-food environments have been increasingly linked to obesity and related outcomes. Individuals who are more sensitive to reward-related cues might be more responsive to such environments. Objective: This study aimed to assess the moderating role of sensitivity to reward on the relation between residential fast-food restaurant exposure and fast-food consumption. Design: Four hundred fifteen individuals (49.6% men; mean age: 34.7 y) were sampled from 7 Montreal census tracts stratified by socioeconomic status and French/English language. The frequency of fast-food restaurant visits in the previous week was self-reported. Sensitivity to reward was self-reported by using the Behavioral Activation System (BAS) scale. Fast-food restaurant exposure within 500 m of the participants' residence was determined by using a Geographic Information System. Main and interactive effects of the BAS and fast-food restaurant exposure on fast-food consumption were tested with logistic regression models that accounted for clustering of observations and participants' age, sex, education, and household income. Results: Regression results showed a significant interaction between BAS and fast-food restaurant exposure (P < 0.001). Analysis of BAS tertiles indicated that the association between neighborhood fast-food restaurant exposure and consumption was positive for the highest tertile (odds ratio: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.20, 1.84; P < 0.001) but null for the intermediate (odds ratio: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.80, 1.34; P = 0.81) and lowest (odds ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.51, 1.37; P = 0.49) tertiles.

2010-02-26,Screening gender on children's television: The views of producers around the world,"Screening Gender on Children's Television offers readers insights into the transformations taking place in the presentation of gender portrayals in television productions aimed at younger audiences. It goes far beyond a critical analysis of the existing portrayals of gender and culture by sharing media professionals' action-oriented recommendations for change that would promote gender equity, social diversity and the wellbeing of children. Incorporating the author's interviews with 135 producers of children's television from 65 countries, this book discusses the role television plays in the lives of young people and, more specifically, in developing gender identity. It examines how gender images presented to children on television are intertwined with important existential and cultural concerns that occupy the social agenda worldwide, including the promotion of education for girls, prevention of HIV/AIDS and domestic violence and caring for 'neglected' boys who lack healthy masculine role models, as well as confronting the pressures of the beauty myth. Screening Gender on Children's Television also explores how children's television producers struggle to portray issues such as sex/sexuality and the preservation of local cultures in a profit-driven market which continually strives to reinforce gender segregation. The author documents pro-active attempts by producers to advance social change, illustrating how television can serve to provide positive, empowering images for children around the world. Screening Gender on Children's Television is an accessible text which will appeal to a wide audience of media practitioners as well as students and scholars. It will be useful on a range of courses, including popular culture, gender, television and media studies. Researchers will also be interested in the breadth of this cross-cultural study and its interviewing methodology."
2010-02-01,"Negotiating with terrorists: Strategy, tactics, and politics","This edited volume addresses the important issue of negotiating with terrorists, and offers recommendations for best practice and processes. Hostage negotiation is the process of trying to align two often completely polarised parties. Authorities view hostage taking as unacceptable demands made by unacceptable means. However terrorists view their actions as completely justified, even on moral and religious grounds. If they are to try and reconcile these two sides, it is essential for hostage negotiators to understand terrorist culture, the hostage takers' profiles, their personality, their view of the world and also the authorities, their values and their framing of the problem raised by the taking of hostages. Although not advocating negotiating with terrorists, the volume seeks to analyse when, why, and how it is done. Part I deals with the theory and quantifiable data produced from analysis of hostage situations, while Part II explores several high profile case studies and the lessons that can be learnt from them. This volume will be of great interest to students of terrorism studies, conflict management, negotiation, security studies and IR in general."

2010-01-01,Hybrid toolboxes: Conceptual and empirical analysis of blending patterns in application of hybrid media,"Hybrid media concepts, i.e. especially combinations of face-to-face instruments and electronic media, represent a standard in many fields of application for quite a long time. Such combinations of diverse, and thus hybrid instruments are meanwhile quite commonly used, for example, in marketing, in retail business, for communication in virtual enterprises, in internal communication processes, in human resource development and in higher education. By combining strengths of two or more media and by mutually compensating their weaknesses, hybrid media concepts aim at enhancing performance with respect to effectiveness and efficiency. So far, however, scientific discussion lacks a common understanding of the architecture of hybrid media concepts as well as empirical evidence on the application of hybrid media in practice. Hence, it is unclear to what extent the performance potential of hybrid media concepts is utilized in different application fields and what the drivers of the use and performance of hybrid media concepts are. This article presents and discusses both a conceptualization of hybrid media in terms of diversity, proportions and coupling of hybrid concepts and empirical evidence on hybrid media concepts in two typical application fields: internal communication in change management and blended learning in higher education."
2010-01-01,Sense of mastery and metabolic risk: Moderating role of the local fast-food environment,"Objective: To test the moderating role of the extent of fast-food restaurants in one's immediate environment in the association between mastery and metabolic risk. Higher sense of mastery (perceived control over one's circumstances) has been associated with better metabolic outcomes. Mastery may be instrumental in resisting unhealthful environmental food cues when these become ubiquitous, resulting in a greater health impact of mastery. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 344 individuals (50% men), aged 18 to 57 years (mean, 34.9 years), sampled from seven census tracts representing the spectrum of census tract-level socioeconomic status and language (French/English) in Montreal. Risk factors based on standards for high-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol, waist circumference, body mass index, triglycerides, and glycated hemoglobin were summed to obtain a cumulative metabolic risk score. Mastery was self-reported, using a validated scale. The proportion of restaurants classified as fast-food within 500 m of participants' residences was determined, using a geographic information system. Main and interactive effects were tested with Poisson regression, accounting for clustering of observations and participants' age, gender, education, and income. Results: Mastery interacted with fast-food exposure in relation to metabolic risk (p =.03). Higher mastery was significantly associated with lower metabolic risk for participants surrounded by a high proportion of fast food (relative risk, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.84; p <.0001), but not for those living in areas with low proportion of fast-food restaurants (relative risk, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-1.08; p =.37). Conclusions: A positive relationship between mastery and lower metabolic risk was most apparent in environments with higher fast-food exposure. © 2010 by the American Psychosomatic Society."

2009-12-01,"Associations between area-level unemployment, body mass index, and risk factors for cardiovascular disease in an urban area","Introduction: Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) has been linked to ""neighbourhood"" socioeconomic status (nSES), often operationalized as a composite index of aggregate income, occupation and education within predefined administrative boundaries. The role of specific, non-composite socioeconomic markers has not been clearly explained. It is also unclear whether the relationship between nSES and CVD varies according to sex. We sought to determine whether area-level unemployment (ALU) was associated with CVD risk, and whether this association differed by sex. Methods: 342 individuals from the Montreal Neighbourhood Survey of Lifestyle and Health provided self-reported behavioural and socioeconomic information. A nurse collected biochemical and anthropometric data. ALU, a weighted average of the proportion of persons 15-years and older available for but without work, was measured using a Geographic Information System for a 250 m buffer centred on individual residence. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to estimate the associations between ALU, body mass index (BMI) and a cumulative score for total cardiometabolic risk (TCR). Results: After confounder adjustments, the mean 4th minus 1st quartile difference in BMI was 3.19 kg/m2 (95% CI: 2.39, 3.99), while the prevalence ratio for the 4 th relative to 1st quartile for TCR was 2.20 (95 % CI: 1.53, 3.17). Sex interacted with ALU; women relative to men had greater mean 3.97 kg/m2 (95% CI: 2.08, 5.85) BMI and greater mean TCR 1.51 (95% CI: 0.78, 2.90), contrasted at mean ALU. Conclusions: Area-level unemployment is associated with greater CVD risk, and this association is stronger for women. © 2009 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International."
2009-12-01,Assessing global diffusion with Web memetics: The spread and evolution of a popular joke,"Memes are small units of culture, analogous to genes, which flow from person to person by copying or imitation. More than any previous medium, the Internet has the technical capabilities for global même diffusion. Yet, to spread globally, memes need to negotiate their way through cultural and linguistic borders. This article introduces a new broad method, Web memetics, comprising extensive Web searches and combined quantitative and qualitative analyses, to identify and assess: (a) the different versions of a meme, (b) its evolution online, and (c) its Web presence and translation into common Internet languages. This method is demonstrated through one extensively circulated joke about men, women, and computers. The results show that the joke has mutated into several different versions and is widely translated, and that translations incorporate small, local adaptations while retaining the English versions' fundamental components. In conclusion, Web memetics has demonstrated its ability to identify and track the evolution and spread of mêmes online, with interesting results, albeit for only one case study. © 2009 ASIS&T."
2009-11-01,Supporting adaptation to climate change: What role for official development assistance?,"The formal financial mechanisms for managing adaptation to climate change under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are falling significantly short of meeting needs in the most vulnerable countries. Given the close relationship between development and adaptation, it is tempting to use existing channels of development assistance to fill this gap. However, it is imperative that development assistance is not seen as a substitute for specific adaptation finance. This article therefore attempts to distinguish between the two roles, and considers how development assistance might support and complement adaptation funding and action under the Convention, rather than competing with or substituting it. © The Authors 2009.

2009-09-21,Modeling source-filter interaction in belting and high-pitched operatic male singing,"Nonlinear source-filter theory is applied to explain some acoustic differences between two contrasting male singing productions at high pitches: operatic style versus jazz belt or theater belt. Several stylized vocal tract shapes (caricatures) are discussed that form the bases of these styles. It is hypothesized that operatic singing uses vowels that are modified toward an inverted megaphone mouth shape for transitioning into the high-pitch range. This allows all the harmonics except the fundamental to be ""lifted"" over the first formant. Belting, on the other hand, uses vowels that are consistently modified toward the megaphone (trumpet-like) mouth shape. Both the fundamental and the second harmonic are then kept below the first formant. The vocal tract shapes provide collective reinforcement to multiple harmonics in the form of inertive supraglottal reactance and compliant subglottal reactance. Examples of lip openings from four well-known artists are used to infer vocal tract area functions and the corresponding reactances. © 2009 Acoustical Society of America."
2009-08-01,Effects of loud and amplified speech on sentence and word intelligibility in Parkinson disease,"Purpose: In the two experiments in this study, the author examined the effects of increased vocal effort (loud speech) and amplification on sentence and word intelligibility in speakers with Parkinson disease (PD). Methods: Five talkers with PD produced sentences and words at habitual levels of effort and using loud speech techniques. Amplified sets of sentences and words were created by increasing the intensity of habitual stimuli to the level of loud stimuli. Listeners rated the intelligibility of the 3 sets of sentences on a 1-7 scale and transcribed the 3 sets of words. Results: Both loud speech and amplification significantly improved intelligibility for sentences and words. Loud speech resulted in greater intelligibility improvement than amplification. Conclusions: By comparing loud and amplified scores, about one third to one half of intelligibility improvement with loud speech could be attributed to increases in audibility or signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, factors other than increased intensity must be partly responsible for the loud speech benefit. Changes in articulation appear to play a relatively small role: Initial /h/was the only consonant to consistently show improvement with loud speech. Phonatory changes such as improvements in F0 and spectral tilt may account for improved speech intelligibility using loud speech techniques. © American Speech-Language-Hearing Association."

Qualitative content analysis reveals that moral panic is commonly used in news reports in the USA, UK, Australia, and other countries, but it is more likely to be compatible with print (e.g. newspaper) formats than television reports. It is also widely used in literary and art reviews, editorials and op-ed pieces, often by social scientists. Use of the concept has increased over the last decade, particularly in news reports as part of an 'opposing' voice or the 'other side' of articles about deviant behavior, sexual behavior, and drug use. It is suggested that moral panic as 'opposition' fits the entertainment news format, and while this sustains its use by writers and familiarity to audience members, it also appears to be associated with certain topics (e.g. sex and drugs), but not others, such as terrorism in the mainstream media. Questions are raised for additional research. © 2009 SAGE Publications."
2009-03-24,Television studies after TV: Understanding television in the post-broadcast era,"Television studies must now address a complex environment where change has been vigorous but uneven, and where local and national conditions vary significantly. Globalizing media industries, deregulatory policy regimes, the multiplication, convergence and trade in media formats, the emergence of new content production industries outside the US/UK umbrella, and the fragmentation of media audiences are all changing the nature of television today: its content, its industrial structure and how it is consumed. Television Studies after TV leads the way in developing new ways of understanding television in the post-broadcast era. With contributions from leading international scholars, it considers the full range of convergent media now implicated in understanding television, and also focuses on large non-Anglophone markets - such as Asia and Latin America - in order to accurately reflect the wide variety of structures, forms and content which now organise television around the world."

Participants completed questionnaires that included a position generator for collecting network social capital data. Measures of WC, height and weight were collected by registered nurses. To estimate associations with cardiometabolic risk, data on WC for individuals with BMI between 18.5 and 34.9 were extracted for analysis (n = 291). Using a proportional odds model with clustered robust standard errors, we evaluated the association of three different measures of individual social capital with elevated and substantially elevated WC and overweight and obesity categories of BMI. These measures were then evaluated in their associations with elevated WC and BMI, adjusting for socio-demographic and behavioral covariates.ResultsNetwork social capital was inversely associated with the likelihood of being in an elevated WC risk category (odds ratio (OR) = 0.81, 95 confidence intervals (CI: 0.69, 0.96) and higher BMI category (OR = 0.81, 95 CI: 0.71, 0.92).ConclusionHigher individual network social capital is associated with a lower likelihood of elevated WC risk and overweight and obesity."
2009-01-01,Terrorism Programming,"Mass media reports about terrorism prepared audiences for the Iraq War. Expanded social control efforts, including surveillance and suspension of civil liberties, were deemed necessary to fight terrorism. The fight against terrorism and the Iraq War were presented to audiences through an exhaustive propaganda campaign that included dramatisation of enemy threats, how to consume and be patriotic. All of this required a complicit news media that carried governmental claims and justifications. Analysis of news coverage suggests that this war was presented as Terrorism Programming, or the selective use of claims makers/news sources within a normative pattern, which included occasional detractors to give the appearance of debate. The implications of this approach for social control are discussed, along with suggestions for future research. © 2009, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved."
2009-01-01,"Property Rites: The Rhinelander trial, passing, and the protection of whiteness","In 1925 Leonard Rhinelander, the youngest son of a wealthy New York society family, sued to end his marriage to Alice Jones, a former domestic servant and the daughter of a ""colored"" cabman. After being married only one month, Rhinelander pressed for the dissolution of his marriage on the grounds that his wife had lied to him about her racial background. The subsequent marital annulment trial became a massive public spectacle, not only in New York but across the nation-despite the fact that the state had never outlawed interracial marriage. Elizabeth Smith-Pryor makes extensive use of trial transcripts, in addition to contemporary newspaper coverage and archival sources, to explore why Leonard Rhinelander was allowed his day in court. She moves fluidly between legal history, a day-by-day narrative of the trial itself, and analyses of the trial's place in the culture of the 1920s North to show how notions of race, property, and the law were-and are-inextricably intertwined. © 2012 The University of North Carolina Press.

2009-01-01,Regional variations on a global theme: Formatting television for the Middle East and beyond,"The issue of cultural interchange of foreign programming is growing ever more pertinent within the deregulated television industries of emergent economies and regions. Adaptation of global program formats has become a common practice around the world, though it has proven more challenging in the Middle East, in a context of variable religious conservatism, political freedoms and economic affluence. Drawing on case histories of format adaptations that have experienced differing degrees of success within the region, this paper develops inductively a typology for contingent creative strategies, namely replica, indigene, collage and hybrid. With an eye to targeting both advertisers and audiences, television networks and program producers might thus cater to diverse cultural sensibilities across sub-regional audiences when broadcasting regionally. Finally, the paper highlights under-researched issues surrounding media reproduction for geolinguistic regions."
2009-01-01,Misinformation and the “war on terror”: When memory turns fiction into fact,"If you would be a real seeker after truth, it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as possible, all things. (Descartes, <italic>Principles of Philosophy</italic> (1644)) “Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction”; “we know where they are.” These statements, made in 2002 and 2003 by the US Vice President, Dick Cheney, and the US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, respectively, turned out to have no basis in fact when the post-invasion search for weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in Iraq failed to turn up any tools of chemical or biological warfare, let alone the massive stockpiles that US officials insisted had been hidden by the Iraqi regime. Notwithstanding, polls conducted in the United States for up to a year after the invasion, by which time the absence of WMDs had become fully evident and made public, continued to reveal a persistent belief in their existence among 20% to 40% of respondents (Kull <italic>et al</italic>., 2004; PIPA, 2004). Indeed, for several months after President Bush declared the war to have ended (May 1, 2003), some 20% of respondents additionally believed that Iraq had in fact <italic>used</italic> chemical or biological weapons on the battlefield during the immediately preceding conflict (Kull <italic>et al</italic>., 2004.) Lest one think that these figures merely represent some inertia of opinion, with those erroneous beliefs inexorably fading over time, polls conducted in March, 2006, revealed that nearly a quarter of Americans continued to believe that Iraq possessed WMDs just before the invasion (PIPA, 2006)."
2009-01-01,"Hear no, speak no: Sasaki Maki manga and nansensu, circa 1970","The 1960s dawned in Japan with a crisis in liberal political ideals concerning the spoken word. The events of Anpo 60 had shown that force and private interest, rather than open and rational debate, governed postwar parliamentary democracy. Disillusionment with the expressive, communicative and political capacities of speech became a centerpiece of the Japanese counterculture through the 1960s and into the early 1970s. At its most cynical and anti-political, this disenchantment went under the name nansensu (nonsense), a term popular within the Japanese student movement circa 1970. Manga, as a medium in which the representation of speaking activity is central, could not but be affected by the contemporary crisis of the spoken word. This essay considers how the manga of Sasaki Maki (b. 1946) from this period both thematized this crisis and was beset by the problems embodied in the term nansensu. © 2009 BAJS."

2009-01-01,"Demographic and urban form correlates of healthful and unhealthful food availability in montréal, canada","Objective: This study sought to extend previous analyses of food insecurity in Montréal by examining the relationship between neighbourhood sociodemographic and urban form variables and sources of food both unhealthful (fast-food outlets, FFO) and healthful (stores selling fruits and vegetables, FVS). Methods: Densities of FFO and FVS were computed for 862 Census tract areas (CTA) (defined as census tract with a 1 -km buffer around its limits) for the Montréal Census Metropolitan Area (CMA). Predictor variables included CTA socio-demographic characteristics reflecting income, household structure, language, and education, and urban form measures, specifically, densities of local roads, main roads, expressways and highways. Food source densities were regressed on CTA characteristics using stepwise regression. Results: Socio-demographic and urban form measures explained 60% and 73% of the variance in densities of FFO and FVS, respectively. FFO were more prevalent in CTA with higher proportions of full-time students and households speaking neither French nor English; lower proportions of married individuals, children and older adults; and more high-traffic roads. FVS were more prevalent in CTA with higher proportions of single residents, university-educated residents and households speaking neither French nor English; lower proportion of French-speakers; and more local roads. Median household income was not related to the density of FFO or FVS. Conclusion: The availability of healthful and unhealthful food varies across the Montréal CMA. Areas with lower education and more French-speaking households have a lesser availability of FVS. The association of FFO with high-traffic roadways and areas with high school attendance suggests a point for intervention via commercial zoning changes. © Canadian Public Health Association, 2009.

2008-08-01,Climate change policy and policy change in China,"Solving the climate change problem by limiting global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will necessitate action by the world's two largest emitters, he United States and China. Neither has so far committed to quantitative emissions limits. Some argue that China cannot be engaged on the basis of its national interest in climate policy, on the ground that China's national net benefits of limiting greenhouse gas emissions would be negative, as a result of significant GHG abatement costs and potential net gains to China from a warmer world. This premise has led some observers to advocate other approaches to engaging China, such as appeal to moral obligation. This Article argues that appeal to national net benefits is still the best approach to engage China. First, appealing to China's asserted moral obligation to limit its GHG emissions may be ineffective or even counterproductive. Even if climate change is a moral issue for American leaders, framing the issue that way may not be persuasive to Chinese leaders. Second, the concern that China's rational net benefits of climate policy are negative is based on older forecasts of costs and benefits. More recent climate science, of which the Chinese leadership is aware, indicates higher damages to China from climate change and thus greater net benefits to China from climate policy. Third, he public health co-benefits of reducing other air pollutants along with GHGs may make GHG emissions limits look more attractive to China. Fourth, the distribution of climate impacts within China may be as important as the net aggregate: climate change may exacerbate political and social stresses within China, which the leadership may seek to avoid in order to maintain political stability. Fifth, the costs of abatement may decline as innovation in China accelerates. Sixth, as China becomes a great power in world politics, and as climate change affects China's allies, leadership on climate policy may look more favorable to China's elites. Seventh, the design of the international climate treaty regime itself can offer positive incentives to China. Taken together, these factors point to a potential and even ongoing shift in Chinese climate policy. They illustrate how the international law and politics of climate change depend on domestic politics and institutions. And they suggest that the United States, if it too takes effective action, can make the case for enlightened pragmatism as a basis to engage China in a cooperative global climate policy regime."
2008-04-01,Dinner at Vidas's (Informal introductory to the first film by Nikola Tanhofer Nije bilo uzalud),"Analyzing the film Nije bilo uzalud, the first feature film by the Croatian film and photography director Nikola Tanhofer, the essay places it in the context of the Croatian (and Yugoslavian) cinema of the fifties. The essay emphasises its innovativeness based on the principles of the classical plot style (formulated in the USA already in the silent film period), comparable to the principles of the classical German cinema. The thorough analysis of the dialogue scene which takes place in the interior of the Tanhofer's film (the dinner scene) illustrates that in Tanhofer's film the visual attractiveness is not conditioned by spectacular contents (like for example swamp exteriors). Film style produces a special kind of spectacle. Comparing the role of Tanhofer in the Croatian film history with the role of Mileti}, Bauer, Golik, Belan and others, the essay also tries to answer the question of why authors such as Tanhofer did not make the right impact and did not find real successors in the given historical and aesthetic context."

In this passionate and dazzling book, Toby Miller dares to answer this question with the depth of thought it deserves. Fast-moving and far-ranging, Cultural Citizenship blends fact, theory, observation, and speculation in a way that continually startles and engages the reader. Although he is unabashedly liberal in his politics, Miller is anything but narrow minded. He looks at media coverage of September 11th and the Iraq invasion as well as ""infotainment"" such as Food and Weather channels to see how U.S. TV is serving its citizens as part of ""the global commodity chain."" Repeatedly revealing the crushing grip of the invisible hand of television, Miller shows us what we have given up in our drive to acquire and to ""belong."" For far too long, ""cultural citizenship"" has been a concept invoked without content.

International development assistance is more frequently being applied to strengthening governance in developing countries, and in Exporting Good Governance: Temptations and Challenges in Canada's Aid Program, the editors bring together diverse perspectives to investigate whether aid for good governance works. The first section of the book outlines the changing face of international development assistance and ideas of good governance. The second section analyzes six nations: three are countries to which Canada has devoted a significant portion of its aid efforts over the past five to ten years: Ghana, Vietnam, and Bangladesh. Two are newer and more complex ""fragile states,"" where Canada has engaged: Haiti and Afghanistan. These five are then compared with Mauritius, which has enjoyed relatively good governance. The final section looks at challenges and new directions for Canadas development policy."
2007-09-01,"Humanism, Reading, and English Literature 1430-1530","This book traces the influence of humanism on English literature during the fifteenth century, much earlier than the influence is usually thought to be felt. It considers humanist influences on the reception of some of Chaucer's work and on important authors such as John Lydgate, Osbern Bokenham, William Caxton, Sir John Tiptoft, Henry Medwall, and Sir Thomas Elyot, and in many anonymous translations, political treatises, and documents such as On Husbondrie, Knyghthode and Bataile, and Somnium Vigilantis. At its heart is a consideration of William Worcester, the 18h-century scholar. The method is a blend of literary criticism and codicology, informed by an interest in the 'history of reading' more common in studies of the late 16th and 17th centuries than of earlier periods. The book examines evidence in manuscript and early print of the English study and imitation of antiquity, in marginalia on classical works, and in the ways in which people copied and shared translations. It then examines how various English works were shaped by such reading-habits and, in turn, how those English works reshaped the reading-habits of the wider community. Humanism thus, contrary to recent strictures against it, appears not as 'top-down' dissemination but as a practical process of give-and-take between writers and readers. Humanism also prompts writers to imagine their potential readership in ways which challenge them to re-imagine the commonweal, common good, or imagined community of the realm, and the intellectual freedom of the reader."
2007-08-01,Sexual content on mainstream TV advertising: A cross-cultural comparison,"A content analysis of 1,785 American ads and 1,467 Israeli ads maps the representation of sexual content on mainstream TV advertising in the two countries. This content appears in less than 5% of the advertisements. Most of it is mild and portrayed in the conservative context of an established relationship. Explicit material, socially discouraged practices, references to sexual responsibility and complete nudity are extremely rare. Israeli advertisements tend to present a higher share of sexual content than American ads, and male models are more likely to be partially nude than female models-but these differences are minor in extent. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

2007-01-01,Head-related transfer functions and the physics of spatial hearing,"This chapter explores the physics of hearing using the methods that Lord Rayleigh developed and apply the resulting model to synthesize our own head-related transfer function (HRTF). Most HRTFs are proprietary data sets measured using proprietary techniques. While the numerical algorithm for the purpose of demonstration uses a highly simplistic model, it is useful to generate and visualize HRTF data based on first principles. The HRTF describes the acoustical transfer function that is related to a person’s head. The so-computed information of the generic HRTF contains a spectral dependent runtime, increasing the incoming wave for a reduced and very simple head. The transfer function of any system inserted into a signal path describes the change in sound from input to output. In this example, the amplification factor and all frequency specific changes are part of the acoustical transfer function of the megaphone."

2007-01-01,Belva Lockwood: The woman who would be president,"In Belva Lockwood: The Woman Who Would Be President, prize-winning legal historian Jill Norgren recounts, for the first time, the life story of one of the nineteenth century's most surprising and accomplished advocates for women's rights. As Norgren shows, Lockwood was fearless in confronting the male establishment, commanding the attention of presidents, members of Congress, influential writers, and everyday Americans. Obscured for too long in the historical shadow of her longtime colleague, Susan B. Anthony, Lockwood steps into the limelight at last in this engaging new biography. Born on a farm in upstate New York in 1830, Lockwood married young and reluctantly became a farmer's wife. After her husband's premature death, however, she earned a college degree, became a teacher, and moved to Washington, DC with plans to become an attorney-an occupation all but closed to women. Not only did she become one of the first female attorneys in the U.S., but in 1879 became the first woman ever allowed to practice at the bar of the Supreme Court. In 1884 Lockwood continued her trailblazing ways as the first woman to run a full campaign for the U.S. Presidency. She ran for President again in 1888. Although her candidacies were unsuccessful (as she knew they would be), Lockwood demonstrated that women could compete with men in the political arena. After these campaigns she worked tirelessly on behalf of the Universal Peace Union, hoping, until her death in 1917, that she, or the organization, would win the Nobel Peace Prize. Belva Lockwood deserves to be far better known. As Norgren notes, it is likely that Lockwood would be widely recognized today as a feminist pioneer if most of her personal papers had not been destroyed after her death. Fortunately for readers, Norgren shares much of her subject's tenacity and she has ensured Lockwood's rightful place in history with this meticulously researched and beautifully written book. © 2007 by New York University.

2007-01-01,The mass media and terrorism,"The mass media promotes terrorism by stressing fear and an uncertain future. Major changes in US foreign and domestic policy essentially went unreported and unchallenged by the dominant news organizations. Notwithstanding the long relationship in the United States between fear and crime, the role of the mass media in promoting fear has become more pronounced since the United States ‘discovered’ international terrorism on 11 September 2001. Extensive qualitative media analysis shows that political decision-makers quickly adjusted propaganda passages, prepared as part of the Project for the New American Century (PNAC), to emphasize domestic support for the new US role in leading the world. These messages were folded into the previous crime-related discourse of fear, which may be defined as the pervasive communication, symbolic awareness, and expectation that danger and risk are a central feature of everyday life. Politicians marshaled critical symbols and icons joining terrorism with Iraq, the Muslim faith, and a vast number of non-western nations to strategically promote fear and use of audience beliefs and assumptions about danger, risk and fear in order to achieve certain goals, including expanding domestic social control. © 2007, Sage Publications.

2006-12-01,Democracy's promise: Immigrants and American civic institutions,"The massive demographic changes in the United States during the past few decades have made understanding the place of immigrants in the public sphere more critical than ever. Democracy's Promise examines both the challenges and opportunities posed to American civic institutions by the presence of increasing numbers of immigrants. ""As political parties (perhaps) decline in the United States, as civic organizations (perhaps) move away from direct participatory politics, and as the number of immigrants certainly increases-what will link new Americans to the political realm? Janelle Wong answers this important question clearly, with elegance, nuance, rich description, and galvanizing provocativeness. Her evidence is compelling and her sense of urgency about the need for parties to look beyond short-term interests even more so."" -Jennifer L. Hochschild, Harvard University ""Wong draws on the Latino and Asian immigrant experience, with specific examples from the Chinese and Mexican communities of New York and Los Angeles, to show how the political parties have largely failed to organize these groups and why labor unions and immigrant advocacy organizations have stepped in to take their place. Far from 'disuniting' America, she clearly shows that bringing these groups into the political fray is central to the project of renewing American democracy."" -John Mollenkopf, CUNY Graduate Center ""A scathing critique of the role of parties in the mobilization of new immigrants and an invaluable analysis of alternative pathways of mobilization through community organizations."" -Michael Jones-Correa, Cornell University ""By employing multiple empirical methods, including in-depth interviews and sophisticated survey analyses, Janelle Wong provides a compelling account of the political activities and allegiances of America's Asian and Latino immigrants that challenges much conventional wisdom. Often the political parties are failing to reach out to these groups, and often immigrants remain concerned about their home countries; but they are nonetheless increasingly active in American politics, in ways that may do much to shape the course of American political development in the 21st century. Democracy's Promise is a major contribution to our understanding of this crucial dimension of American politics."" -Rogers M. Smith, University of Pennsylvania ""Democracy's Promise challenges political parties to reexamine their priorities for mobilizing new voters, and identifies the critical role civic institutions play in invigorating participation among immigrant citizens.

2006-12-01,Conclusion,
2006-12-01,Terrorism and the politics of fear,"This article examines how news reports about terrorism in five nationally prominent U.S. newspapers reflect the terms and discourse associated with the politics of fear, or decision makers' promotion and use of audience beliefs and assumptions about danger, risk, and fear, to achieve certain goals. Qualitative data analysis of the prevalence and meaning of the words fear, victim, terrorism, and crime 18 months before and after the attacks of September 11, 2001, shows that terrorism and crime are now linked very closely with the expanding use of fear, there was a dramatic increase in linking terrorism to fear, coverage of crime and fear persisted but at a very low rate, and there was a large increase in news reports linking terrorism to victim. The implications for the social constructionist approach to social problems and social control are discussed. © 2006 Sage Publications."
2006-11-01,Catalytic asymmetric reactions using environmentally friendly reagents and catalyst: Asymmetric synthesis versus kinetic resolution,"Kinetic resolution of racemic compounds is a familiar method for the preparation of optically active compounds. However, an inevitable and critical drawback from the point of view of green chemistry is the consequent wastage of half of the starting compound. A catalytic asymmetric synthesis of 5-arylcyclohex-2-enones was developed starting from racemic 5-(trimethylsilyl) cyclohex-2-enone, which overcomes the drawback of kinetic resolution. A chiral amidophosphane- or BINAP-Rh(I)-catalyzed asymmetric conjugate arylation of racemic 5-(trimethylsilyl)cyclohex-2-enone with arylboronic acids in dioxane-water (10:1) afforded trans- and cis-3-aryl-5-(trimethylsilyl) cyclohexanones in reasonably high enantioselectivity. Dehydrosilylation of the product mixture with Cu(II) chloride in dimethylformamide (DMF) gave 5-arylcyclohex-2-enones with up to 93% ee in high yield. Enantiofacial selectivity with chiral phosphane-Rh(I) overrides the trans-diastereoselectivity that is maintained in the achiral or racemic phosphane-Rh(I)-catalyzed conjugate arylation of 5-(trimethylsilyl)cyclohex-2-enone. © 2006 IUPAC."

2006-07-01,The decision to begin talks with terrorists: Lessons for policymakers,"Governments have many means to begin a dialogue with terrorist groups. The offer of talks may lead terrorists' constituents to reduce their support for violence, and moderates within a group itself may also turn away from violence. Despite these potential benefits, even the consideration of entering discussions carries many risks. Talks with U.S. officials do indeed reward the use of terrorism, tangibly demonstrating that groups can kill innocents and yet become legitimate interlocutors - a reward that is costly both in terms of reducing the prevalence of this tactic worldwide and because it inevitably angers local allies fighting the groups. Moreover, talks often fail in a variety of ways, giving the terrorists a breathing space to rearm and organize and leaving the government looking foolish. Because talks often fail, policymakers should carefully explore whether the conditions are right for any hope of success before they begin a dialogue."

2006-04-13,Conflict terrorism and the media in Asia,"There are many different kinds of sub-national conflicts across Asia, with a variety of causes, but since September 11, 2001 these have been increasingly portrayed as part of the global terrorist threat, to be dealt with by the War on Terror. This major new study examines a wide range of such conflicts, showing how, despite their significant differences, they share the role of the media as interlocutor, and exploring how the media exercises this role. The book raises a number of issues concerning how the media report different forms of political violence and conflict, including issues of impartiality in the media's relations with governments and insurgents, and how the focus on the 'War on Terror' has led to some forms of violence - notably those employed by states for political purposes - to be overlooked. As the issue of international terrorism remains one of the most pressing issues of the modern day, this is a significant and important book which will interest the general reader and scholars from all disciplines."
2006-01-01,Sinn Fein and the media in Northern Ireland: The New Terrain of policy articulation,"This article is an empirical study about Sinn Fein and how the party perceives the role of the news media in relation to its political goals and aspirations within the Northern Ireland peace process. Drawing from interviews carried out with a number of Sinn Fein representatives, it brings to light the organisational priorities of the party when dealing with the news media and provides insights into the various considerations which come into play when trying to shape the news agenda. Importantly, this work offers an original and timely exposition of Sinn Fein’s approach to media strategy and indicates how the party, one of the leading protagonists in the peace process, tries to use the news to develop positions and apply pressures in order to try and shape the communication of policy in Northern Ireland. © 2006 Political Studies Association of Ireland."
2006-01-01,Music: Sound: Technology,"An overview America, Gertrude Stein declared, was “the oldest country in the world because… America created the twentieth century” - not through art or literature, one infers, but through industry and invention. Thus it was Thomas Alva Edison, arguably, who inaugurated modernism in America. He electrified the country, he changed night into day - and he transformed sound for ever. Before Edison's phonograph, sound was ephemeral: Something heard could not be heard again. True, certain sounds - music - could be documented in written scores; but such artifacts merely traced experiences that truly existed only in the moment. Recordings changed all that; and by making sound permanent, they altered music's very nature. “Modern” music, then, is in large part the story of sound technology, of its consequences, and of the responses by musicians and listeners. In the beginning, recordings were mechanical. A reverse megaphone focused sound waves onto a diaphragm to which was attached a stylus; this etched an image of the sound onto a cylinder. To hear the recording, the process was reversed. There was nothing electrical, nothing chemical: The mechanism was wholly consistent with the technology for musical instruments, which took the relatively small sounds produced by an agitated string, a reed, or buzzing lips, and rendered them audible over a substantial distance. The gramophone differed only in that the sound source was a diaphragm activated by a needle driven by grooves in wax."

2006-01-01,"Media literacy and ""weather wars:"" hard science and hardball politics at NASA","On one level, global warming has invoked a debate regarding the ecological future of the Earth. Thus, the geophysical stakes are obviously very high. On another level, it is a debate that will determine how the six-plus billion human beings who live on the Earth obtain and use - and profit from - the energy that sustains their lives. It is, thus, a debate about basic changes in an energy paradigm based on fossil fuels. The stakes being wagered by established industrial interests (most notably oil companies) also are enormous. Societal reaction to global warming is profoundly influenced by general public understanding of complex scientific issues. Attempts to influence public opinion (and media literacy) on this issue have been very sharp. The following case study examines concepts of basic media literacy; in this instance, reaction by the George W. Bush White House to findings of scientists on the government payroll whose findings diverge very fundamentally from its own perceptions of global warming's immediacy and dangers. In particular, James E. Hansen, who directs NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Sciences in New York City, stepped into the public arena and turned a gag order into a megaphone, insisting that NASA's mission, to inform the public of scientific reality, was conflicting with a White House position that was mainly shaped by fossil-fuel executives' notions of spin control. This examination outlines Hansen's battles with White House ""spin control"" on climate change during 2005 and 2006, and media reaction to this conflict. © University of Toronto Press."
2006-01-01,Outcome of percutaneous transarterial coil occlusion in patients with isolated patent ductus arteriosus using an upstream-and-push maneuver,"Background: There are limited data on the outcome of percutaneous transarterial coil occlusion for isolated patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in Taiwan. This study evaluated the 2-year outcome of 52 patients with isolated PDA who received percutaneous transarterial coil occlusion by an upstream-and-push maneuver. Methods: From July 1997 to June 2002, a total of 52 patients (25 infants, 27 children) underwent occlusion of PDA with standard Gianturco coils. There were 39 females and 13 males. Patient age ranged between 7 days and 14 years, and weight was between 3 and 45 kg. Percutaneous transarterial coil occlusion was performed by an upstream-and-push maneuver. Chest auscultations, chest radiographs, and Doppler echocardiography were performed in all patients within 24 hours, and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after coil occlusion. Results: Mean PDA diameter at the pulmonary end was 2.34 ± 1.00 mm (range, 1.00-4.80 mm). Angiographic classification was megaphone type in 32 patients, window type in seven, tubular type in six, aneurysmal type in three, and elongated conical type in four. Complete PDA occlusion was performed with a single coil in 41 (79%) patients and with multiple coils in 11 (21%). The mean ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow was 1.95 ± 0.95 (range, 1.10-5.80) before the procedure, and 1.02 ± 0.04 (range, 1.00-1.20) after the procedure (p < 0.001). Immediate occlusion of the ductus was achieved 15 minutes after the procedure in 44 (85%) patients. Occlusion was achieved in 92% of patients within 24 hours and in 100% of patients by the 1-month follow-up. Follow-up at 24 months after the procedure revealed no complications. Conclusion: Percutaneous transarterial coil occlusion with 5-loop Gianturco coils can be effectively and safely achieved in patients with a PDA minimum diameter < 5 mm. ©2006 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association."
2005-12-01,High availability considerations for a distributed computer-based railway information system,"In this paper we present an implementation of a computer-based railway information system. This system requires a distributed infrastructure that should offer a high availability. The solution proposed is distributed into three kind of nodes: a node that implements the system interface for administering and monitoring using an ubiquitous web application, a central computer that storage the data and serves as the union nexus and an embedded computer on each station for controlling the station elements (displays, megaphones, etc). The system can also make VoIP connections between the interface and the station. This paper describes the major issues faced during the designing of this railway information systems that are related to achieve a high availability. © 2005 IEEE."

2005-10-06,The media and peace: From Vietnam to the 'War on terror',"Much is known about the media's role in conflict, but far less is known about the media's role in peace. Graham Spencer's study addresses this deficiency by providing a comparative analysis of reporting conflicts from around the world and examining media receptiveness to the development of peace. This book establishes an argument for the need to rethink journalistic responsibility in relation to peace and interrogates the consequences of news coverage that emphasizes conflict over peace."
2005-09-29,Asymmetric synthesis of 5-arylcyclohexenones by rhodium(I)-catalyzed conjugate arylation of racemic 5-(trimethylsilyl)cyclohexenone with arylboronic acids,(Chemical Equation Presented) A catalytic asymmetric conjugate arylation of racemic 5-(trimethylsilyl)cyclohex-2-enone with arylboronic acids was catalyzed by 3 mol % chiral amidophosphane- or BINAP-Rh(I) in dioxane-water (10:1) to afford trans- and cis-3-aryl-5-(trimethylsilyl)cyclohexanones in high enantioselectivity. Dehydrosilylation of the product mixture with cupric chloride in DMF gave 5-arylcyclohex-2-enones with up to 93% ee in good yield. Enantiofacial selectivity with chiral phosphane-Rh(I) exceeds the trans-diastereoselectivity that is maintained in the achiral or racemic phosphane-Rh(I)-catalyzed conjugate arylation of 5-(trimethylsilyl) cyclohexenone. © 2005 American Chemical Society.

2005-08-01,"Television dependency in independent kazakhstan: Programming via relay, import and adaptation","With little written on media in this oft-forgotten part of Asia, this article seeks to analyse a model of television development within a key post-Soviet state. The research found that there was little programme production or adaptation in Kazakhstan but much done by Russian television on which the former's channels were dependent. The Russian programming was either broadcast directly, relayed in part by domestic channels or comprised individual programmes purchased for use locally. Thus this article argues that Russia acts as a sub-franchisor in redistributing global creative products, exploiting commonalities in the regional geolinguistic market created through its past communist imperialism. A national policy placing increasing emphasis on Kazak-ization of media has triggered demand for 'localized' programming in this transitional Central Asian economy. Yet given the market imperatives of privatized media, this has encouraged the dubbing and adaptation of successful regional and global programmes formats in Russian, rather than production of local originals. In doing so, Kazakhstan may be discerned to be supporting Russia in its role as a semi-periphery country in global cultural production and export, thus mediating capitalism within its non-European region of transitional economies.

2005-04-01,Whither health promotion events? A judicial approach to evidence,"This paper reports on a review undertaken for the Health Education Board for Scotland on 'health events'. On the basis of a literature review and interviews with 20 professionals in the UK, it appraised the effectiveness of such activities, assessed their current extent and status, and ultimately considered whether they are useful and relevant within emergent contexts. It suggests that the evidence base for health events is relatively weak, particularly given the scale of such work. At best, all that can be said is that there is some evidence that some of these events have some use within very specific assumptions and values. Consideration is given to possible ways forward. The paper also considers a series of related issues that impinge on the assessment of complex health promotion interventions. From our field interviews, health events are perceived by most to be labour intensive and ineffective. Rather, they are undertaken for a range of pragmatic 'public relations' reasons that exist independent of knowledge, attitudinal or behavioural outcomes. This ambiguity of expectation coupled with a paucity of published high-quality literature led to the use of a judicial approach to evidence appraisal. It considers the ways in which this exercise could be undertaken, ultimately being sceptical of systematic meta-reviews. © Oxford University Press 2005; All rights reserved."
2005-03-23,A theoretical study on the origin of π-facial stereoselectivity in the alkylation of enolates derived from 4-substituted γ-butyrolactones,"The alkylation of 4-methoxymethyl-γ-butyrolactone enolate with methyl chloride was studied at the B3LYP/6-31+G* level. Conformer search of the free enolate gave 15 unique conformers within 5.39 kcal/mol. The transition structures for both anti- and syn-attacks of methyl chloride on these 15 conformers were located. In all cases, the anti-transition structures are more stable than the corresponding syn-ones. The alkylation of γ-valerolactone was studied at the MP2, B3LYP, and HF levels of theory with the 6-31+G* basis set in the presence of Li+ and dimethyl ether molecules. Basis set effects were also examined by the comparison of the MP2 results with the 6-31+G*, 6-31+G**, and 6-311+G** basis sets in one case. This study shows that the main source of the anti-selectivity of 4-substituted γ-butyrolactones is eclipsing strain in the syn-transition structures. © 2005 American Chemical Society."

2005-01-01,"Human rights treaties: Considering patterns of participation, 1948-2000","The book examines patterns of participation in human rights treaties. International relations theory is divided on what motivates states to participate in treaties, specifically human rights treaties. Instead of examining the specific motivations, this dissertation examines patterns of participation. In doing so, it attempts to match theoretical expectations of state behavior with participation. This book provides significant evidence that there are multiple motivations that lead states to participate in human rights treaties."
