2011-12-08,"Facile fabrication of rare-earth-doped Gd<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> hollow spheres with upconversion luminescence, magnetic resonance, and drug delivery properties","Rare-earth (RE)-doped gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3) hollow nanospheres have been successfully prepared on a large scale via a template-directed method using hydrothermal carbon spheres as sacrificed templates. Scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope images reveal that these hollow-structured nanospheres have the mesoporous shells that are composed of a large amount of uniform nanoparticles. By doping the RE ions (Yb/Er) into the Gd2O3 host matrix, these NPs emitted bright multicolored upconversion emissions that can be fine-tuned from green to red by adjusting the codoped Yb/Er ratio under 980 nm NIR laser excitation. The possibility of using these upconversion nanoparticles for optical imaging in vivo has been demonstrated. It was also shown that these Gd2O3 nanospheres brightened the T1-weighted images and enhanced the r1 relaxivity of water protons, which suggested that they could act as T1 contrast agents for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Moreover, these hollow spheres can be used as drug delivery host carriers, and drug storage/release properties were investigated using ibuprofen as the model drug. As a result, the so-prepared nanoscaled Gd2O3 hollow spheres bearing upconversion luminescence, MR imaging, and drug delivery capabilities could be potentially employed for simultaneous MR/fluorescent imaging and therapeutic applications. © 2011 American Chemical Society."
2011-12-01,Chitosan hydrogel microsphere-templated microcapsules carrying heparin via layer-by-layer self-assembly,"BACKGROUND: Electrostatic layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly is a simple, effective and novel approach to carrying macromolecules into microcapsule carriers. OBJECTIVE: To prepare chitosan (CS) microcapsules to control the releasing of heparin (Hep) by LbL. METHODS: CS microspheres were fabricated by a sodium sulfate-based precipitation process and then used as positively charged templates for polyelectrolyte multilayer coatings to carry heparin by the LbL self-assembly technique. The polycation was CS and the polyanion was Hep. The microcapsule was formed via coating {CS/Hep}3 on CS hydrogel template. The microcapsules composed of {CS/ Hep}3 on CS hydrogel templates were confirmed by fluorescence inverted microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy and laser particle size analysis. The assembly of polyelectrolyte layers on CS hydrogel microspheres was monitored by Zeta Potential Analyzer. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The resulting microcapsules were about 1 um in average diameter, and allowed spontaneous loading of heparin through electrostatic interaction, with the encapsulation efficiency and carrying capacity of 83.8% and 3.05%, respectively."
2011-12-01,Theoretical insights into the structures of graphene oxide and its chemical conversions between graphene,"In this paper we review recent computational insights into the oxidation of graphene, the reduction of graphene oxide, and the molecular models and electronic structures of graphene oxide. First, we will set the stage by giving a brief overview of recent exciting experimental progresses in chemistry of graphite oxide and graphene oxide. Then, we will discuss computational efforts to understand oxidation mechanisms of graphene. Next, we will examine computational efforts to elucidate the molecular and electronic structures of graphene oxide. Further, we will interrogate the reduction mechanisms of graphene oxide. In the end, we provide a perspective how the computational and experimental efforts will converge on the chemistry of graphene oxide.

2011-12-01,An attempt to study of the C60 fullerene on differentiation of mouse ES cells,"We examined the differentiation capacity of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells cultured on C60 fullerene, as well as cell viability effects, employing a cellular differentiation technique for the embryonic stem cell test (EST). The results demonstrated minor effects on differentiation assay, beating myocardial rate of the dispersed solution was noted in 72% of the control. In addition, there was no influence on cell viability. In this study, the C60 fullerene did not influence the differentiation of ES-D3 cells and ""non embryotoxicity"". We here investigated C60 fullerene dispersed in a medium. We expected a result of natural dispersion of C60 fullerene into the medium by agitation as possible. This is probably because C60 fullerene did not dispersed. Fullerene particles should be sufficiently dispersed in media. In the future, the biological safety should be comprehensively examined by improving dispersion in medium."
2011-12-01,Methods of detection and identification of manufactured nanoparticles,"The actual methods of detection and identification of manufactured nanoparticles in both simple and complex multi-component matrix for assessing biological effects and safety of nanotechnology products have been reviewed. The detection of priority species of biologically active nanoparticles, which include fullerenes, singleand multi-walled carbon nanotubes, nanoparticles of silver, gold, titanium oxide, aluminum, cerium, zinc and silicon, has been given a special attention. The requirements for sample preparation have been discussed. The results of the successful application for the detection of manufactured nanoparticles in biosamples with methods of scanning and transmission electron microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, size exclusion chromatography, field-flow fractionation, electrophoretic, light scattering, spectrophotometry, fluorescent spectroscopy, X-ray and other spectrometry, mass spectrometry, ""particle counters"", immunochemistry have been reviewed. The possibilities and limitations of different techniques, and their complementarity have been analyzed. © 2011 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."
2011-12-01,The interaction of serum proteins with carbon nanotubes depend on the physicochemical properties of nanotubes,"With more and more potential applications of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in different fields, the risk of exposure to CNTs is increasing. The interaction between CNTs and protein in biological media can affect the way cells interact with, recognize and process the nanoparticles, and this has important implications for safety considerations. In this study, the interaction of single-walled and multiwall CNTs with various serum proteins was investigated. The adsorption kinetics of protein to CNTs was investigated and a semi-qualitative analysis was provided by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was used to identify the protein species binding to CNTs and atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to vividly demonstrate the adsorption model of protein on CNTs. All the experimental results showed that the adsorption capacity of CNTs for protein was highly dependent on the type, arrangement model, size and surface modification of CNTs. Significant quantity of proteins in serum could be quickly adsorbed by CNTs, mainly including albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, and immunoglobulin. Noncovalent functionalization of CNTs by polyethylene glycol (PEG) could decrease the protein adsorption on CNTs. These results provide crucial insights into human serum proteins binding to different kinds of CNTs, which is important for understanding the safe application of carbon nanotubes. © 2011 American Scientific Publishers.

2011-12-01,A hypothetical model for predicting the toxicity of high aspect ratio nanoparticles (HARN),"The ability to predict nanoparticle (dimensional structures which are less than 100 nm in size) toxicity through the use of a suitable model is an important goal if nanoparticles are to be regulated in terms of exposures and toxicological effects. Recently, a model to predict toxicity of nanoparticles with high aspect ratio has been put forward by a consortium of scientists. The High aspect ratio nanoparticles (HARN) model is a platform that relates the physical dimensions of HARN (specifically length and diameter ratio) and biopersistence to their toxicity in biological environments. Potentially, this model is of great public health and economic importance, as it can be used as a tool to not only predict toxicological activity but can be used to classify the toxicity of various fibrous nanoparticles, without the need to carry out time-consuming and expensive toxicology studies. However, this model of toxicity is currently hypothetical in nature and is based solely on drawing similarities in its dimensional geometry with that of asbestos and synthetic vitreous fibres. The aim of this review is two-fold: (a) to present findings from past literature, on the physicochemical property and pathogenicity bioassay testing of HARN (b) to identify some of the challenges and future research steps crucial before the HARN model can be accepted as a predictive model. By presenting what has been done, we are able to identify scientific challenges and research directions that are needed for the HARN model to gain public acceptance. Our recommendations for future research includes the need to: (a) accurately link physicochemical data with corresponding pathogenicity assay data, through the use of suitable reference standards and standardised protocols, (b) develop better tools/techniques for physicochemical characterisation, (c) to develop better ways of monitoring HARN in the workplace, (d) to reliably measure dose exposure levels, in order to support future epidemiological studies. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

2011-12-01,Gold nanoparticles: Promising nanomaterials for the diagnosis of cancer and HIV/AIDS,"Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are currently playing a significant role for human welfare in the field of clinical diagnosis as well as several biomedical applications. More and more research shows that AuNPs-based technologies are becoming promising approaches in cancer research and AIDS treatment. In this paper, we have focused mainly on the exploitation of unique and characteristic properties of AuNPs such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), surface enhance Raman scattering (SERS), magnetic properties (MRI), and fluorescence behavior shown upon conjugation with biological and biocompatible ligands. These properties find wide prevalence in biodiagnostics like plasmon-based labeling and imaging, enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), and electrochemical- based methods that can pave the way for developing novel techniques towards diagnosis and therapy of cancer and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS).

2011-12-01,Radiation-induced robust oscillation and non-Gaussian fluctuation,"There have been many recent studies devoted to the consequences of stochasticity in protein circuitry. Stress conditions, including DNA damage, hypoxia, heat shock, nutrient deprivation, and oncogene activation, can result in the activation and accumulation of p53. Several experimental studies show that oscillations can be induced by DNA damage following nuclear irradiation. To explore the underlying dynamical features and the role of stochasticity, we discuss the oscillatory dynamics in the well-studied regulatory network motif. The fluctuations around the fixed point of a delayed system are Gaussian in the limit of sufficiently weak delayed feedback, and remain Gaussian along a limit cycle when viewed tangential to the trajectory. The experimental results are recapitulated in this study. We illustrate several features of the p53 activities, which are robust when the parameters change. Furthermore, the distribution in protein abundance can be characterized by its non-Gaussian nature. © 2011 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd."
2011-12-01,Cytotoxicity of single-walled carbon nanotubes on human hepatoma HepG2 cells: An iTRAQ-coupled 2D LC-MS/MS proteome analysis,"Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and its derivatives are promising candidates for applications in electronics, energy, materials and biomedical areas. However, with the growing potential biomedical applications and the rising societal concerns on nanosafety, mechanistic understanding of the interactions between nanomaterials and living systems has become imperative. In the present study, our group applied the iTRAQ-coupled 2D LC-MS/MS approach to analyze the protein profile change of mammalian cells in response to SWCNTs. Specifically, the human hepatoma HepG2 cells were chosen as the in vitro model to study the potential cytotoxicity of SWCNTs on the vital organ of liver. Overall 51 differentially expressed proteins that involved in metabolic pathway, redox regulation, signaling pathway, cytoskeleton formation and cell growth were identified. We found SWCNTs triggered the up-regulation of metabolic enzymes, heat shock proteins and proteins involved in redox regulation, which indicated SWCNTs could induce oxidative stress, perturb protein synthesis and interfere cellular metabolism. Our data also suggested that SWCNTs might induce the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, and finally lead to stress-induced apoptosis. The comparative protein profile obtained here provided molecular evidence on the cellular functions in response to SWCNTs, which should very useful to elucidate the cytotoxicity caused by those nanomaterials. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."
2011-12-01,Variation in the internalization of differently sized nanoparticles induces different DNA-damaging effects on a macrophage cell line,"Although researchers have expended considerable effort on studying the cytotoxicity of nanomaterials, it is possible that there has been insufficient attention paid to their genotoxic potential. Here, we describe a test model that we have developed to evaluate the DNA-damaging effects of negatively charged nanoparticles of different sizes. We compared the DNA damaging effect induced by nanoparticles of various sizes and found that the effect is closely associated with the internalization pattern of the particles. Macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with carboxylated polystyrene beads (COOH-PBs) ranging in size from 30 to 500 nm. Size-dependent DNA damage was detected, and the lesion induced by two carboxylated fullerene particles confirmed this observation. Confocal microscopy revealed that the entry pathways of these COOH-PBs shifted from direct penetration to endocytosis with increasing particle size, followed by changes in subcellular localization. Subsequent deposition of 30-nm COOH-PBs in the cytosol led to a reduction of Zn 2+ and Mg 2+ content in the nucleus and an increased p53 level in the whole cell rather than in nucleus, while localization of 50- and 100-nm COOH-PBs in acidic vesicles induced p53 accumulation in both types of extracts. Based on these results, we assume that the damage resulted from a disruption of the balance between DNA damage and repair. © 2011 Springer-Verlag."
2011-12-01,"Construction of amphiphilic copolymer nanoparticles based on hyperbranched Poly (Amine-Ester) and 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-Sn-Glycero-3-Phosphoethanolamine as drug carriers for cancer therapy","Novel amphiphilic copolymer nanoparticles (HPAE-co-PLA-DPPE) composed of hyperbranched poly (amine-ester), polylactide and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPPE) segments were designed and synthesized that provided high encapsulation efficiency. These nanoparticles (NPs) were used to encapsulate an antitumor model drug, doxorubicin (DOX). The resulting NPs exhibited high encapsulation efficiency to DOX under an appropriate condition. In vitro release experiments revealed that the release of DOX from NPs was faster at pH 4.5 than that at pH 7.4 or pH 6.0. Confocal microscopy observation indicated that the DOX-loaded NPs can enter cells and localize in lysosomes that can be released quickly into the cytoplasm. The DOX-loaded NPs showed comparable anticancer efficacy with the free drug both in vivo and in vitro. These results demonstrate a feasible application of the hyperbranched copolymer, HPAE-co-PLA-DPPE, as a promising nanocarrier for intracellular delivery of antitumor drugs. From the Clinical Editor: In this paper, the development of novel amphiphilic copolymer nanoparticles is discussed with the goal of establishing high encapsulation efficiency for chemotherapy drugs. © 2011 Elsevier Inc."
2011-12-01,Separation of hydrogen and nitrogen gases with porous graphene membrane,"We designed a series of porous graphene as the separation membrane of H2/N2. The selectivity and permeability could be controlled by drilling various nanopores with different shapes and sizes. The mechanisms of hydrogen and nitrogen to permeate through the porous graphene are different. The small nanopore (pore-11) can only allow the hydrogen molecules to permeate due to the size restriction. In the systems of bigger nanopores (e.g., pore-13, pore-14, etc.), where the pore size is big enough to allow nitrogen molecules to permeate without any restriction, we observed more permeation events of nitrogen than that of hydrogen molecules. The reason is that the van der Waals interactions with the graphene membrane make the nitrogen molecules accumulate on the surface of graphene. When the pore size further increases, the flow of hydrogen molecules exhibits the linear dependence on the pore area, while there is no obvious correlation between the flow of nitrogen molecules and the pore area. © 2011 American Chemical Society."
2011-12-01,Developmental Toxicity of Engineered Nanoparticles,"This chapter discusses developmental toxicity of engineered nanoparticles. Revolutionary developments of physics, chemistry and material sciences have led to the emergence of nanotechnology. Nano-objects have found different applications as diagnostic and therapeutic tools in biomedicine. Engineered nanoparticles are defined by differences in their shape, size, surface charge and chemical composition, mostly due to the mode of their production. Some of the nanoparticles are carbon nanoparticle, carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, inorganic nanoparticles and inorganic nanotubes. Non-degradable nanomaterials can accumulate in organs and inside cells where they can exert detrimental effects. One major uncertainty in interpretation of experimental toxicity studies as well as in risk assessment of engineered nanomaterial arises from lack of systematic knowledge about the physico-chemical characteristics of the material arriving at the major portals through which nanoparticles can enter the body, i.e. lung, skin, gastro-intestinal tract, nasal olfactory structures and eyes. The small size of nanoparticles allows them to easily enter and traverse tissues, cells and organelles since the actual size of engineered nanoparticles is similar to that of many biological molecules and structures. Nanoparticles are translocated from lung to blood and across the blood-brain barrier as well as the placenta. Maternal exposure to engineered nanoparticles may potentially affect fetal development directly as well as through indirect pathways. Engineered nanomaterials can cause inflammation, allergy, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. The need for risk assessment of engineered nanomaterials has also generated a need for a novel risk assessment concept. The goal of control banding is to prevent excessive exposure to compounds such as engineered nanomaterials. © 2011 Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.."
2011-12-01,Phytotoxicity and biotransformation of La <inf>2</inf>O <inf>3</inf> nanoparticles in a terrestrial plant cucumber (Cucumis sativus),"With the increasing applications of metal-based nanoparticles in various commercial products, it is necessary to address their environmental fate and potential toxicity. In this work, we assessed the phytotoxicity of lanthanum oxide (La 2O 3) NPs to cucumber plants and determined its distribution and biotransformation in roots by TEM and EDS, as well as STXM and NEXAFS. LaCl 3 was also studied as a reference toxicant. La 2O 3 NPs and LaCl 3 were both transformed to needle-like LaPO 4 nanoclusters in the intercellular regions of the cucumber roots. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the dissolution of La 2O 3 NPs was significantly enhanced by acetic acid. Accordingly, we proposed that the dissolution of NPs at the root surface induced by the organic acids extruded from root cells played an important role in the phytotoxicity of La 2O 3 NPs. The reactions of active NPs at the nano-bio interface should be taken into account when studying the toxicity of dissolvable metal-based nanoparticles. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd."
2011-12-01,Preparation of thermoresponsive and pH-sensitivity polymer magnetic hydrogel nanospheres as anticancer drug carriers,"In this work, a novel thermo and pH responsive magnetic hydrogel nanosphere poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid)/Fe 3O 4 (poly(NIPAAm-co-AA)/Fe 3O 4) has been successfully prepared. The magnetic hydrogel nanospheres with thermo and pH-sensitivity were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared-spectrometer (FT-IR), UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The magnetic hydrogel nanospheres exhibited uniform sphere structures and superparamagnetic property. Finally, the drug loading capacities and the releasing behavior of the magnetic hydrogel nanospheres were investigated with doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) as an anticancer drug model. The resulting magnetic hydrogel nanospheres exhibited high encapsulation efficiency (95%) to DOX under an appropriate condition. In vitro release experiments revealed that release was faster at pH 5.3 (37°C) than at pH 7.4 (25°C) or pH 7.4 (37°C). The DOX-loaded magnetic hydrogel nanospheres also showed enhanced anticancer effect compared with the free drug in vitro. These presented results suggested that the magnetic hydrogel nanospheres have a potential as tumor targeting drug carrier. © 2011 Elsevier B.V."

The phosphor exhibits more than 4 h afterglow in the wavelength range of 650850 nm after ceasing the ultraviolet light (280360 nm) irradiation. The trap structure and persistent luminescence mechanism were revealed by thermoluminescence measurement.

2011-12-01,Quantum dot cytotoxicity in vitro: An investigation into the cytotoxic effects of a series of different surface chemistries and their core/shell materials,"The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a series of different surface coated quantum dots (QDs) (organic, carboxylated [COOH] and amino [NH2] polytethylene glycol [PEG]) on J774.A1 macrophage cell viability and to further determine which part of the QDs cause such toxicity. Cytotoxic examination (MTT assay and LDH release) showed organic QDs to induce significant cytotoxicity up to 48 h, even at a low particle concentration (20 nM), whilst both COOH and NH2 (PEG) QDs caused reduced cell viability and cell membrane permeability after 24 and 48 h exposure at 80 nM. Subsequent analysis of the elements that constitute the QD core, core/shell and (organic QD) surface coating showed that the surface coating drives QD toxicity. Elemental analysis (ICP-AES) after 48 h, however, also observed a release of Cd from organic QDs. In conclusion, both the specific surface coating and core material can have a significant impact on QD toxicity. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd."
2011-11-24,Bacterial magnetosome: A novel biogenetic magnetic targeted drug carrier with potential multifunctions,"Bacterial magnetosomes (BMs) synthesized by magnetotactic bacteria have recently drawn great interest due to their unique features. BMs are used experimentally as carriers for antibodies, enzymes, ligands, nucleic acids, and chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition to the common attractive properties of magnetic carriers, BMs also show superiority as targeting nanoscale drug carriers, which is hardly matched by artificial magnetic particles. We are presenting the potential applications of BMs as drug carriers by introducing the drug-loading methods and strategies and the recent research progress of BMs which has contributed to the application of BMs as drug carriers. © 2011 Jianbo Sun et al."
2011-11-23,"Nanoexposure, unusual diseases, and new health and safety concerns","Accumulating studies in animals have shown that nanoparticles could cause unusual rapid lung injury and extrapulmonary toxicity. Whether exposure of workers to nanoparticles may result in some unexpected damage as seen in animals is still a big concern. We previously reported findings regarding a group of patients exposed to nanoparticles and presenting with an unusual disease. The reported disease was characterized by bilateral chest fluid, pulmonary fibrosis, pleural granuloma, and multiorgan damage and was highly associated with the nanoparticle exposure. To strengthen this association, further information on exposure and the disease was collected and discussed. Our studies show that some kinds of nanomaterials, such as silica nanoparticles and nanosilicates, may be very toxic and even fatal to occupational workers exposed to them without any effective personal protective equipment. More research and collaborative efforts on nanosafety are required in order to prevent and minimize the potential hazards of nanomaterials to humans and the environment.

2011-11-23,Release-ability of nano fillers from different nanomaterials: Part 1: Aerosolisation of nanoparticles just deposited at the top surfaces,"It is of great interest to set up a reproducible and sensitive method able to qualify the nanomaterials before their market introduction in terms of their constitutive nanoparticle release-ability in usage. The same team already optimized during 3 years a specific method using a normalized abrasion by a Taber tool. In this work, new practical solicitations are investigated on the basis of a theoretical approach of the release phenomena in dry conditions of nanoparticles just deposited on hard and soft surfaces (the ""micro football kick out effect""). It is shown that a metallic rake used roughly on both hard and soft nanomaterials surfaces can be 10 times more efficient than the Taber method. Nanoparticles smaller than 50 nm are almost impossible to remove even using very rough solicitations."
2011-11-22,Serial silver clusters biomineralized by one peptide,"The artificial peptide with amino acid sequence CCYRGRKKRRQRRR was used to biomineralize serial Ag clusters. Under different alkaline conditions, clusters with red and blue emission were biomineralized by the peptide, respectively. The matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectra implied that the red-emitting cluster sample was composed of Ag28, while the blue-emitting cluster sample was composed of Ag5, Ag6, and Ag7. The UV-visible absorption and infrared spectra revealed that the peptide phenol moiety reduced Ag+ ions and that formed Ag clusters were captured by peptide thiol moieties. The phenol reduction potential was controlled by the alkalinity and played an important role in determining the Ag cluster size. Circular dichroism observations suggested that the alkalinity tuned the peptide secondary structure, which may also affect the Ag cluster size. © 2011 American Chemical Society."
2011-11-22,Gold nanoparticles induce autophagosome accumulation through size-dependent nanoparticle uptake and lysosome impairment,"Development of nanotechnology calls for a comprehensive understanding of the impact of nanomaterials on biological systems. Autophagy is a lysosome-based degradative pathway which plays an essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Previous studies have shown that nanoparticles from various sources can induce autophagosome accumulation in treated cells. However, the underlying mechanism is still not clear. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are one of the most widely used nanomaterials and have been reported to induce autophagosome accumulation. In this study, we found that AuNPs can be taken into cells through endocytosis in a size-dependent manner. The internalized AuNPs eventually accumulate in lysosomes and cause impairment of lysosome degradation capacity through alkalinization of lysosomal pH. Consistent with previous studies, we found that AuNP treatment can induce autophagosome accumulation and processing of LC3, an autophagosome marker protein. However, degradation of the autophagy substrate p62 is blocked in AuNP-treated cells, which indicates that autophagosome accumulation results from blockade of autophagy flux, rather than induction of autophagy. Our data clarify the mechanism by which AuNPs induce autophagosome accumulation and reveal the effect of AuNPs on lysosomes. This work is significant to nanoparticle research because it illustrates how nanoparticles can potentially interrupt the autophagic pathway and has important implications for biomedical applications of nanoparticles. © 2011 American Chemical Society."
2011-11-22,Self-organizing circuit assembly through spatiotemporally coordinated neuronal migration within geometric constraints,"Background: Neurons are dynamically coupled with each other through neurite-mediated adhesion during development. Understanding the collective behavior of neurons in circuits is important for understanding neural development. While a number of genetic and activity-dependent factors regulating neuronal migration have been discovered on single cell level, systematic study of collective neuronal migration has been lacking. Various biological systems are shown to be self-organized, and it is not known if neural circuit assembly is self-organized. Besides, many of the molecular factors take effect through spatial patterns, and coupled biological systems exhibit emergent property in response to geometric constraints. How geometric constraints of the patterns regulate neuronal migration and circuit assembly of neurons within the patterns remains unexplored. Methodology/Principal Findings: We established a two-dimensional model for studying collective neuronal migration of a circuit, with hippocampal neurons from embryonic rats on Matrigel-coated self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). When the neural circuit is subject to geometric constraints of a critical scale, we found that the collective behavior of neuronal migration is spatiotemporally coordinated. Neuronal somata that are evenly distributed upon adhesion tend to aggregate at the geometric center of the circuit, forming mono-clusters. Clustering formation is geometry-dependent, within a critical scale from 200 μm to approximately 500 μm. Finally, somata clustering is neuron-type specific, and glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons tend to aggregate homo-philically. Conclusions/Significance: We demonstrate self-organization of neural circuits in response to geometric constraints through spatiotemporally coordinated neuronal migration, possibly via mechanical coupling. We found that such collective neuronal migration leads to somata clustering, and mono-cluster appears when the geometric constraints fall within a critical scale. The discovery of geometry-dependent collective neuronal migration and the formation of somata clustering in vitro shed light on neural development in vivo. © 2011 Sun et al."
2011-11-21,Regioselectivity control of graphene functionalization by ripples,"Ripples naturally occur in graphene sheets. First-principles calculations reveal that, by altering the pyramidalization angles of the carbon atoms, these ripples can be used to direct the chemical reactivity of graphene towards hydrogenation. A fraction of the carbon atoms of a rippled graphene, located around the crests and troughs, show significantly increased reactivity. The remaining carbon atoms have comparable reactivity to those in a flat graphene. To illustrate the increased reactivity, we show that hydrogenation becomes exothermic when the characteristic ratio between the amplitude and wavelength reaches ∼0.55. This finding offers a practical chemical venue for regioselectivity control of graphene functionalization. While the rippling does not directly affect the band gap of the graphene, the rippling-induced hydrogenation does. © the Owner Societies 2011."

From the 2D-events contour plot, the presence of Hg 2+ can be confirmed in as little as 30 min at ∼7 nM or higher. The sensor is highly selective to Hg 2+, without interference from other metal ions. It can be fabricated from readily available materials, without the processes of synthesis, purification, probe-making, and so forth. This sensing strategy opens new possibilities for detecting many types of analytes which have specific interactions with DNA molecules. © 2011 American Chemical Society."
2011-11-10,Rutile TiO<inf>2</inf> particles exert size and surface coating dependent retention and lesions on the murine brain,"The rising commercial use and large-scale production of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) may lead to unintended exposure to humans. The central nervous system (CNS) is a potential susceptible target of the inhaled NPs, but so far the amount of studies on this aspect is limited. Here, we focus on the potential neurological lesion in the brain induced by the intranasally instilled titanium dioxide (TiO2) particles in rutile phase and of various sizes and surface coatings. Female mice were intranasally instilled with four different types of TiO2 particles (i.e. two types of hydrophobic particles in micro- and nano-sized without coating and two types of water-soluble hydrophilic nano-sized particles with silica surface coating) every other day for 30 days. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were used to determine the titanium contents in the sub-brain regions. Then, the pathological examination of brain tissues and measurements of the monoamine neurotransmitter levels in the sub-brain regions were performed. We found significant up-regulation of Ti contents in the cerebral cortex and striatum after intranasal instillation of hydrophilic TiO2 NPs. Moreover, TiO2 NPs exposure, in particular the hydrophilic NPs, caused obvious morphological changes of neurons in the cerebral cortex and significant disturbance of the monoamine neurotransmitter levels in the sub-brain regions studied. Thus, our results indicate that the surface modification of the NPs plays an important role on their effects on the brain. In addition, the difference in neurotoxicity of the two types of hydrophilic NPs may be induced by the shape differences of the materials. The present results suggest that physicochemical properties like size, shape and surface modification of the nanomaterials should be considered when evaluating their neurological effects. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."
2011-11-08,European centre for nanotoxicology: A proactive risk-assessment nanotechnology initiative,"Nanotechnology is one of the key technologies of the 21st century and is associated with high expectations. However, the larger surface area of nanoparticles makes them highly reactive compared to the larger sized particles of the same chemistry. Due to their size, they are able to cross differing biological barriers resulting in both, desirable and undesirable effects. Current knowledge about toxicological effects is limited and standardization of nanomaterial application is poor. Thus, a paradigm shift towards more proactive assessment has been identified. There are several international (European Commission, Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development) and national key institutions active in the field of nanotoxicology. In 2007, the European Centre for Nanotoxicology (EURO-NanoTox), an Austrian hub for scientific knowledge in the field of nanotoxicology, was founded. This Centre acts as a national contact point with international visibility for researchers and industries, and it has co-operative partnerships on academic and industrial levels. The variety of the scientific backgrounds and techniques offered by the partners allows the centre to describe biological actions of nanoparticles from different perspectives and to embed them into international research. Additionally, EURO-NanoTox is in co-operation with the key institutions on the European level to ensure that human health and the environmental safety aspects of nanotechnology are adequately addressed. © Academy of Sciences Malaysia."

2011-11-04,Fate and toxicity of metallic and metal-containing nanoparticles for biomedical applications,"It is important to obtain a better understanding of the uptake, trafficking, pharmacokinetics, clearance, and role of nanomaterials in biological systems, so that their possible undesirable effects can be avoided. A number of metallic or metal-containing nanomaterials, such as gold nanoparticles and nanorods, quantum dots, iron oxides nanoparticles, and endohedral metallofullerenes, have already been or will soon become very promising for biomedical applications. This review presents a summary of currently available data on the fate and toxicity of these metallic or metal-containing nanoparticles based on animal studies. Several issues regarding the nanotoxicity assessment and future directions on the study of the fate of these nanoparticles are also proposed. A summary of currently available data on the fate and toxicity of metallic or metal-containing nanoparticles, including gold, quantum dots, iron oxide and metallofullerenes, are presented mainly through animal studies. A better understanding of the uptake, trafficking, pharmacokinetics, clearance, and roles of nanomaterials in biological systems is important for avoiding their undesirable effects. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2011-11-01,Carbon-tuned bonding method significantly enhanced the hydrogen storage of BN-Li complexes,"Through first-principles calculations, we found doping carbon atoms onto BN monolayers (BNC) could significantly strengthen the Li bond on this material. Unlike the weak bond strength between Li atoms and the pristine BN layer, it is observed that Li atoms are strongly hybridized and donate their electrons to the doped substrate, which is responsible for the enhanced binding energy. Li adsorbed on the BNC layer can serve as a high-capacity hydrogen storage medium, without forming clusters, which can be recycled at room temperature. Eight polarized H 2 molecules are attached to two Li atoms with an optimal binding energy of 0.16-0.28 eV/H 2, which results from the electrostatic interaction of the polarized charge of hydrogen molecules with the electric field induced by positive Li atoms. This practical carbon-tuned BN-Li complex can work as a very high-capacity hydrogen storage medium with a gravimetric density of hydrogen of 12.2 wt%, which is much higher than the gravimetric goal of 5.5 wt % hydrogen set by the U.S. Department of Energy for 2015. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry."
2011-11-01,Epigenetic modulation of human breast cancer by metallofullerenol nanoparticles: In vivo treatment and in vitro analysis,"Multi-hydroxylated endohedral metallofullerenol [Gd@C 82(OH) 22] n nanoparticles possess the general physico-chemical characteristics of most nanoparticles. They also exhibit uniquely low toxicity and antineoplastic efficacy. In the current study, the molecular mechanisms and epigenetic characteristics of the antineoplastic action of these nanoparticles are explored. Human breast cancer MCF-7 and human umbilical vein endothelial ECV304 cell lines were used. Cell viability assay, cell hierarchical cluster analysis by cDNA microarray, semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were conducted to investigate the changes in molecular and cellular signaling pathways caused by [Gd@C 82(OH) 22] n. The results demonstrated the high antitumor activity and low cytotoxicity of [Gd@C 82(OH) 22] n nanoparticles both in vivo and in vitro. Their possible anti-tumor mechanisms were also discussed. The present study may provide new insight into the mechanism of action of these nanoparticles. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry."

2011-11-01,Targeting of nanoparticles in cancer: Drug delivery and diagnostics,"Anticancer agents continue to be a preferred therapeutic option for several malignancies. Despite their effectiveness, oncologists are continually looking for tumor-specific anticancer agents to prevent adverse effects in patients. Targeting of imaging agents to cancerous tissue is another area that is enthusiastically explored to circumvent some of the drawbacks that current imaging agents possess, including the inability to target small tumor cells, inadequate imaging period, and the risk of renal damage. Formulation scientists have explored nanotechnology-based delivery systems for targeting anticancer agents and tumor-imaging agents to cancer tissue. Targeting with nanotechnology-based delivery systems has been investigated by both passive and active mechanisms with significant clinical success. This review presents a discussion on targeting strategies used for the delivery of nanoparticles by passive and active mechanisms, focusing more specifically on active targeting of nanoparticles using albumin, folic acid, transferrin, and aptamers as targeting ligands. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."
2011-11-01,Enhanced anti-tumor efficacy by co-delivery of doxorubicin and paclitaxel with amphiphilic methoxy PEG-PLGA copolymer nanoparticles,"The use of single chemotherapeutic drug has shown some limitations in anti-tumor treatment, such as development of drug resistance, high toxicity and limited regime of clinical uses. The combination of two or more therapeutic drugs is feasible means to overcome the limitations. Co-delivery strategy has been proposed to minimize the amount of each drug and to achieve the synergistic effect for cancer therapies. Attempts have been made to deliver chemotherapeutic drugs simultaneously using drug carriers, such as micelles, liposomes, and inorganic nanoparticles (NPs). Here we reported core-shell NPs that were doubly emulsified from an amphiphilic copolymer methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (mPEG-PLGA). These NPs offered advantages over other nanocarriers, as they were easy to fabricate by improved double emulsion method, biocompatible, and showed high loading efficacy. More importantly, these NPs could co-deliver hydrophilic doxorubicin (DOX) and hydrophobic paclitaxel (TAX). The drug-loaded NPs possessed a better polydispersity, indicating that they are more readily subject to controlled size distribution. Studies on drug release and cellular uptake of the co-delivery system demonstrated that both drugs were effectively taken up by the cells and released simultaneously. Furthermore, the co-delivery nanocarrier suppressed tumor cells growth more efficiently than the delivery of either DOX or TAX at the same concentrations, indicating a synergistic effect. Moreover, the NPs loading drugs with a DOX/TAX concentration ratio of 2:1 showed the highest anti-tumor activity to three different types of tumor cells. This nanocarrier might have important potential in clinical implications for co-delivery of multiple anti-tumor drugs with different properties. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."
2011-11-01,Intracellular dynamics of cationic and anionic polystyrene nanoparticles without direct interaction with mitotic spindle and chromosomes,"The fate of nanomaterials with different sizes and charges in mitotic cells is of great importance but seldom explored. Herein we investigate the intracellular fate of negatively charged carboxylated polystyrene (COOH-PS) and positively charged amino-modified polystyrene (NH 2-PS) nanoparticles of three different diameters (50, 100 and 500 nm) on cancer HeLa cells and normal NIH 3T3 cells during the cell cycles. The results showed that all the fluorescent PS nanoparticles differing in size and/or charge did not interact with chromosome reorganization and cytoskeleton assembly during the mitotic process in live cells. They neither disturbed chromosome reorganization nor affected the cytoskeleton reassembly in both normal and cancer cells. However, NH 2-PS at the size of 50 nm caused G1 phase delay and a decrease of cyclin (D, E) expression, respectively. Moreover, NH 2-PS displayed higher cellular toxicity and NH 2-PS of 50 nm disturbed the integrity of cell membranes. Both cationic and anionic PS nanoparticles had a more pronounced effect on normal NIH 3T3 cells than cancer HeLa cell. Our research provides insight into the dynamic fate, intracellular behavior, and the effects of nanoparticles on spindle and chromosomes during cell division, which will enable the optimization of design and selection of much safer nanoparticles for lower risk to human health and widely medical applications. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."
2011-10-28,5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine activates iron uptake and heme biosynthesis by increasing c-Myc nuclear localization and binding to the E-boxes of Transferrin Receptor 1 (TfR1) and ferrochelatase (Fech) genes,"The hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) and its derivatives have been successfully used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, and they frequently improve the anemia that usually accompanies these disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this action remain poorly understood. In this study, we used two erythroid models, murine erythroid leukemia cells and erythroid burst-forming unit-derived erythroblasts, to show that 5-aza-CdR induced erythroid differentiation and increased the expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and ferrochelatase (Fech), thereby increasing iron uptake and heme biosynthesis. We have identified new regulatory E-boxes that lie outside of CpG islands in the TfR1 and Fech promoters, and the methylation status of these sites can be altered by 5-aza-CdR treatment. This in turn altered the binding of the transcription factor c-Myc to these promoter elements. Furthermore, 5-aza-CdR promoted the nuclear translocation of c-Myc and its binding toMaxto form functional complexes. The coordinated actions of 5-aza-CdR on the methylation status of the target genes and in stimulating the nuclear translocation of c-Mycprovide new molecular insights into the regulation of E-boxes and explain, at least in part, the increased erythroid response to 5-aza-CdR treatment. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc."
2011-10-18,Theranostic nanoparticles engineered for clinic and pharmaceutics,"Nanomedicine is the manipulation of human biological systems at the molecular level using nanoscale or nanostructured materials. Because nanoscale materials interact effectively with biological systems, the use of nanodiagnostics and nanotherapeutics may overcome many intractable health challenges. A variety of nanoparticles have been designed with modifiable functional surfaces and bioactive cores. The engineering of nanoparticles can result in several advantageous therapeutic and diagnostic properties including enhanced permeation and retention in the circulatory system, specific delivery of drugs to target sites, highly-efficient gene transfection, and enhanced medical imaging.These nanoscale materials offer the opportunity to detect chronic diseases early and to monitor the therapeutic effects of nanoformulated drugs used in the clinic. Many of these novel nanoparticles contain both drug(s) and imaging agent(s) within an individual nanoparticle for simultaneous disease diagnosis and therapy. Further integration of therapeutic compounds with diagnostic agents into theranostic nanoparticles would be highly beneficial.However, the unique physiochemical properties that make nanomaterials attractive for therapy and diagnosis may be also associated with potential health hazards. Our research has demonstrated that the biological response to nanomaterials is related to many factors including exposure levels, systemic accumulation and excretion profiles, tissue and organ distribution, and the age of the test subject. Therefore, when engineering new nanomaterials for clinical use, researchers need to consider these factors to minimize toxicity of nanoparticles in these applications. We have fabricated and evaluated nanomaterials such as cationic amphiphilic polymers and metallofullerenes that demonstrate both high efficiency and low toxicity in gene therapy and/or chemotherapy. In this Account, we describe the development of theranostic nanomaterials with low toxicity and illustrate their potential use as novel nanomedicines in translational research. © 2011 American Chemical Society."
2011-10-11,Application of quantum dots in biological imaging,"Quantum dots (QDs) are a group of semiconducting nanomaterials with unique optical and electronic properties. They have distinct advantages over traditional fluorescent organic dyes in chemical and biological studies in terms of tunable emission spectra, signal brightness, photostability, and so forth. Currently, the major type of QDs is the heavy metal-containing II-IV, IV-VI, or III-V QDs. Silicon QDs and conjugated polymer dots have also been developed in order to lower the potential toxicity of the fluorescent probes for biological applications. Aqueous solubility is the common problem for all types of QDs when they are employed in the biological researches, such as in vitro and in vivo imaging. To circumvent this problem, ligand exchange and polymer coating are proven to be effective, besides synthesizing QDs in aqueous solutions directly. However, toxicity is another big concern especially for in vivo studies. Ligand protection and core/shell structure can partly solve this problem. With the rapid development of QDs research, new elements and new morphologies have been introduced to this area to fabricate more safe and efficient QDs for biological applications. © 2011 Shan Jin et al."
2011-10-01,Utilization of unmodified gold nanoparticles in colorimetric detection,"This review begins with an overview of the appealing properties and various applications of gold nanoparticles, and briefly summarizes recent advances in using unmodified gold nanoparticles to detect different kinds of targets including nucleic acids, proteins, metal ions and small organic molecules. The key point to the unmodified gold nanoparticle-based visual detection assay is to control dispersion and aggregation of colloidal nanoparticles by targets of interest, which usually relies on affinities between gold nanoparticles and targets. The degree of dispersion or aggregation can be visualized through the change of the solution color or the precipitation of nanoparticles from the solution. Thus, the existence of the target molecules can be translated into optical signals and monitored by the naked eye conveniently. Finally, some future prospects of this research field are given. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011."
2011-10-01,Structural change of metallofullerene: An easier thermal decomposition,"We have studied for the first time the structural change of high-purity metallofullerene (Gd@C82) upon heat treatment in an ultra-high vacuum system (10-10 Torr) and examined the decomposition product through successive analysis with MS, IR, Raman, TEM, EDS and XPS. It was found that metallofullerene (Gd@C82) had fully collapsed at 580 °C which was lower than that for the complete destruction of C60. The easier decomposition should be ascribed to the encapsulated metal in the carbon cage which could induce the deformation of the C-C bond. The analysis indicated that the broken metallofullerene (Gd@C82) became a kind of graphite-like material with a lot of defects. The Gd atoms leaked out from the carbon cage and aggregated together to form a regular arrangement. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry."

To that purpose rare-earth doped YAG nanoparticles exhibiting down-conversion and quantum cutting properties have been prepared. These nanoparticles have been synthesized with different concentrations of dopants in order to optimize the luminescence and the quantum cutting efficiency.

2011-09-01,Interaction between fullerenes and single-wall carbon nanotubes: The influence of fullerene size and electronic structure,"A series of fullerenes and endohedral metallofullerenes peapods have been synthesized by supercritical method in high filling rate. The interaction between SWNTs and various kinds of fullerenes (C 60, C 70, C 78, C 84) and metallofullerenes (Gd@C 82, Er@C 82, Ho@C 82, Y@C 82) has been further investigated. The slight blue shift of G-band in Raman spectra with respect to pristine SWNTs was attributed to the charge transfer from SWNTs to fullerenes cage. The obvious RBM shift strongly depended on the distance between the inner wall of the SWNTs and the fullerene cage and also partly associated with the electronic structure of the fullerene. These results indicated that the interaction between fullerenes and SWNTs, which was considered to be the van de walls interaction, can be influenced by the cage size and the kind of fullerenes.

2011-09-01,"Nanoparticle carriers based on copolymers of poly (L-aspartic acid co-L-lactide)-1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3-phosphoethanolamine for drug delivery","A novel poly(L-aspartic) derivative (PALDPPE) containing polylactide and 1,2-dipalmitoylsn- glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPPE) segments has been successfully synthesized. The chemical structures of the copolymers were confirmed by Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), NMR (1H NMR, 13C NMR, 31P NMR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the formation ofmicelles of the PAL-DPPE copolymers. In order to estimate the feasibility as novel drug carriers, an anti-tumor model drug doxorubicin (DOX) was incorporated into polymeric micelles by double emulsion and nanoprecipitation method. The DOX-loaded micelle size, size distribution, and encapsulation efficiency (EE) were influenced by the feed weight ratio of the copolymer to DOX. In addition, in vitro release experiments of the DOX-loaded PAL-DPPE micelles exhibited that faster release in pH 5.0 than their release in pH 7.4 buffer. The poly(L-aspartic) derivative copolymer was proved to be an available carrier for the preparation of micelles for anti-tumor drug delivery. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011."
2011-09-01,Carboxylated single-walled carbon nanotubes induce an inflammatory response in human primary monocytes through oxidative stress and NF-jB activation,"A mechanistic understanding of interactions between carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and living systems has become imperative owing to the growing nanomedicine applications and the mounting societal concerns on nanosafety. The addition of different chemical groups leads to a significant change in the properties of CNTs, and the resulting functionalized CNTs are generating great interest in many biological applications, such as biosensors and transporters. This study aimed to assess the toxicity exhibited by carboxylic acid functionalized single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) (with a diameter of 1-2 nm and mean length of 500 nm) and to elucidate possible molecular mechanisms underlying the biological effects of carboxylated SWCNTs in human primary monocytes. The results demonstrated that carboxylated SWCNTs were cytotoxic, triggering apoptosis and G2/M phase arrest in human primary monocytes. Flow cytometric and confocal microscopic analysis indicated that internalized carboxylated SWCNTs were mainly accumulated in the cytoplasm. Exposure of human primary monocytes to carboxylated SWCNTs led to interleukin-8 (IL-8) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation in human primary monocytes. Pretreatment of human primary monocytes with antioxidants or NF-kappa;B-specific inhibitor before exposure to carboxylated SWCNTs significantly abolished carboxylated SWCNTs-induced IL-8 and IL-6 expression. These results provide novel insights into the carboxylated SWCNTs-mediated chemokine induction and inflammatory responses in vitro. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011."
2011-09-01,Hyperbranched poly (amine-ester)-poly(ε-caprolactone) copolymer and their nanoparticles as camptothecin delivery system,"A new amphiphilic hyperbranched poly (amineester)-poly(ε-caprolactone) copolymer (HPAE-co-PCL) was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone and branched poly (amine-ester) (HPAEOHs) with Sn(Oct) 2 as catalyst. The chemical structures of copolymers were determined by FT-IR, 1H-NMR (13CNMR), thermo gravimetric analysis apparatus (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Camptothecin (CPT)-loaded copolymer nanoparticles were prepared by the oil-in water (o/w) emulsion technique method. Their physicochemical characteristics, e.g. morphology and nanoparticles size distribution were then evaluated by means of fluorescence spectroscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). CPT-loaded nanoparticles assumed a spherical shape and have unimodal size distribution. It was found that the chemical composition of the nanoparticles was a key factor in controlling nanoparticles size, drug-loading content, and drug release behavior. As the molar ratio of ε-caprolactone to HPAE increased, the nanoparticles size and drug-loading content increased, and the drug release rate decreased. The antitumor activity of the CPT-loaded HPAE-co-PCL nanoparticles against human hepatoma HEPG2 cells was evaluated by 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. The CPT-loaded HPAE-co-PCL nanoparticles showed comparable anticancer efficacy with the free drug. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."
2011-09-01,Ferromagnetism/antiferromagnetism transition between semihydrogenated and fully-aminated single-wall carbon nanotubes,"We theoretically studied the ferromagnetism/antiferromagnetism (FM/AFM) transition between single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) induced by chemical modifications of semihydrogenation (SH-) and full-amination (NH2-). We found that armchairs with large diameters of SH-CNTs (n > 3) possess FM functions with intense magnetic moments, while armchair NH2-CNTs (n = 4, 6, 8) are antiferromagnetic semiconductors. The FM/AFM transition is mainly dominated by different chemical modifications and sizes of SWCNTs whose distance between carbon atoms of unpaired electrons can regulate the intensity of p-p spin interactions. Moreover, the zigzag SH-CNTs and NH2-CNTs are NM semiconductors. Thus, the electronic and magnetic properties of the SH- or NH2-CNTs can be precisely modulated by controlling the hydrogenation or amination on the different types and diameters of CNTs, which provides a new and also simple process for magnetism optimization design in SWCNTs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011."
2011-09-01,PP1A-mediated dephosphorylation positively regulates YAP2 activity,"Background: The Hippo/MST1 signaling pathway plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. As a major downstream target of the Hippo/MST1 pathway, YAP2 (Yes-associated protein 2) functions as a transcriptional cofactor that has been implicated in many biological processes, including organ size control and cancer development. MST1/Lats kinase inhibits YAP2's nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity through inducing the phosphorylation at serine 127 and the sequential association with 14-3-3 proteins. However, the dephosphorylation of YAP2 is not fully appreciated. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study, we demonstrate that PP1A (catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1) interacts with and dephosphorylates YAP2 in vitro and in vivo, and PP1A-mediated dephosphorylation induces the nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activation of YAP2. Inhibition of PP1 by okadiac acid (OA) increases the phosphorylation at serine 127 and cytoplasmic translocation of YAP2 proteins, thereby mitigating its transcription activity. PP1A expression enhances YAP2's pro-survival capability and YAP2 knockdown sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin treatment. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings define a novel molecular mechanism that YAP2 is positively regulated by PP1-mediated dephosphorylation in the cell survival. © 2011 Wang et al."
2011-09-01,The suppression of prostate LNCaP cancer cells growth by Selenium nanoparticles through Akt/Mdm2/AR controlled apoptosis,"The trace element Selenium is suggested having cancer prevention activity and used as food supplement. Previous results had shown Selenium nanoparticles are safer compared with other Selenium compounds like selenomethionine, sodium selenite and monomethylated Selenium, however, its anticancer activity and intrinsic mechanisms are still elusive. Here, we prepared Selenium nanoparticles and investigated its inherent anticancer mechanisms. We found Selenium nanoparticles inhibit growth of prostate LNCaP cancer cells partially through caspases mediated apoptosis. Selenium nanoparticles suppress transcriptional activity of androgen receptor via down-regulating its mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, Selenium nanoparticles activate Akt kinase by increasing its phosphorylation, promote Akt-dependent androgen receptor phosphorylation and Mdm2 regulated degradation through proteasome pathway. We suggest Selenium nanoparticles suppress prostate cancer cells growth by disrupting androgen receptor, implicating a potential application in cancer treatment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."
2011-08-18,Ferroportin1 deficiency in mouse macrophages impairs iron homeostasis and inflammatory responses,Systemic iron requirements are met predominantly through the recycling of iron from senescent erythrocytes by macrophages a process in which the iron exporter ferroportin (Fpn1) is considered to be essential. Yet the role of Fpn1 in macrophage iron recycling and whether it influences innate immune responses are poorly understood in vivo.We inactivated Fpn1 in macrophages by crossing Fpn1- floxed animals with macrophage-targeted LysM-Cre or F4/80-Cre transgenic mice. Macrophage Fpn1 deletion mice were overtly normal however they displayed a mild anemia and iron accumulation in splenic hepatic and bone marrow macrophages when fed a standard diet. Iron loading was exacerbated after the administration of iron dextran or phenylhydrazine. When Fpn1LysM/LysM mice were challenged with an iron-deficient diet they developed a more severe anemia and strikingly higher splenic iron levels than control mice indicating significantly impaired iron mobilization from macrophages. Because immune responses can be altered by modulating iron status we also examined the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. We found that expression levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were significantly enhanced in Fpn1LysM/LysM macrophages lacking Fpn1. These studies demonstrate that Fpn1 plays important roles in macrophage iron release in vivo and in modulating innate immune responses. © 2011 by The American Society of Hematology.

The chemical composition of QDs however, has raised concerns as to their potential toxicity. Although a thorough examination using specific biochemical endpoints is necessary to assess QD toxicity, an understanding of the interaction of QDs, specifically their uptake and intracellular fate, with biological systems is also essential in determining their potential hazardous effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the uptake and intracellular fate of a series of different surface coated QDs (organic, carboxylated (COOH) and amino (NH2) polyethylene glycol (PEG)) in J774.A1 'murine macrophage-like' cells. Model 20nm and 200nm COOH polystyrene beads (PBs) were also studied. Results showed that COOH and NH2 (PEG) QDs, as well as 20nm and 200nm PBs were located within lysosomes and the mitochondria of macrophages after 2h. Additionally, elemental transmission electron microscopy confirmed both COOH and NH2 (PEG) QDs to be located within membrane-bound compartments at this time point. The data from this study combined with current knowledge, indicates that the intracellular localisation of QDs could be directly related to their toxicity. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

Cells respond properly to external stimuli by using noisy systems. We have clarified the effect of intrinsic noise on the dynamics in the human cancer cells following gamma irradiation. It is shown that the large amplification and increasing mutual information with delay are due to coherence resonance. Furthermore, frequency domain analysis is used to study the mechanisms. © 2011 Liu et al."
2011-08-10,"Microglial activation, recruitment and phagocytosis as linked phenomena in ferric oxide nanoparticle exposure","Microglia as the resident macrophage-like cells in the central nervous system (CNS) play a pivotal role in the innate immune responses of CNS. Understanding the reactions of microglia cells to nanoparticle exposure is important in the exploration of neurobiology of nanoparticles. Here we provide a systemic mapping of microglia and the corresponding pathological changes in olfactory-transport related brain areas of mice with Fe2O3-nanoparticle intranasal treatment. We showed that intranasal exposure of Fe2O3 nanoparticle could lead to pathological alteration in olfactory bulb, hippocampus and striatum, and caused microglial proliferation, activation and recruitment in these areas, especially in olfactory bulb. Further experiments with BV2 microglial cells showed the exposure to Fe2O3 nanoparticles could induce cells proliferation, phagocytosis and generation of ROS and NO, but did not cause significant release of inflammatory factors, including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Our results indicate that microglial activation may act as an alarm and defense system in the processes of the exogenous nanoparticles invading and storage in brain. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

It was proved that supercritical organic fluids were good media to take materials into the nanocavity, not only as solvents but also as reaction agents. Different kinds of metals (Ni, Cu, Ag) and fullerenes (C60, C70, C78, C84, Gd@C 82, Er@C82, Ho@C82, Y@C82) were successfully inserted into nanotubes with small diameters by this technique, with various supercritical fluids such as C2H5OH, CH 3OH or C6H5CH3. The filling rates were proved to be more than 90%. The high filling efficiency and the properties of the as-generated materials were characterized by TEM, Raman, EDS and XPS. In principle, this technique can be applied to construct new types of nanomaterials, if we choose the appropriate supercritical reaction and fluid in the CNTs. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry."
2011-08-01,"Nanomaterials in humans: Identification, characteristics, and potential damage","Nanomaterials are increasingly being used for commercial purposes. However, concerns about the potential risks of exposure to humans have been raised. We previously reported unusual pulmonary disease and death in a group of patients with occupational exposure to spray paint. However, the nanoparticle and chemical composition of the exposure was not fully described. The present study aimed to isolate and identify the nanoparticles observed in the patients' biopsies and report the potential deleterious effects to human lungs using electron microscopy. Using electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray analysis, silica nanoparticles were identified and characterized mainly in macrophages, pulmonary microvessels, vascular endothelial cells, microlymphatic vessels, pleural effusions, and a few in alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary interstitial tissue (with no microscale particles present). Notably, damage to alveolar epithelial cells, macrophages, vascular endothelial cells, and the blood-gas barrier was observed. Given the well-documented toxicity of microscale silica, it is possible that these silica nanoparticles may have contributed in part to the illness reported in these workers. Such a possibility supports the adoption of controls and prevention strategies to minimize inhalation of nanoparticles by workers, and it highlights the urgent need and the importance of the nanosafety study in humans. © 2011 by The Author(s)."
2011-08-01,Multistability in platelets and their response to gold nanoparticles,"The nanoparticle (NP) response of platelets is shown to be critically dependent on extent of preactivation of platelets by an agonist like ADP. A transition from de-aggregatory to aggregatory state is triggered in the presence of gold NPs (AuNP) only in such critical conditions. Adhered and suspended platelets respond differentially to NPs. Preactivation in the adhered state induced by shear force explains such observation. The NP effect is associated with enhanced release reaction, tyrosine phosphorylation and CD62P expression level. Unlike cancer cells, whose response is maximal when NP size is optimal (within the range 50 - 70 nm), the platelet response monotonically increases with reduction of the AuNP size. The uptake study, using quenching of quinacrine hydrochloride fluorescence by AuNP, indicates that accumulation 18 nm AuNP is several-fold higher than the 68 nm AuNP. It is further shown that AuNP response can provide a simple measure for thrombotic risk associated with nano-drugs. © 2011 Elsevier Inc."
2011-07-28,High performance of phosphonate-functionalized mesoporous silica for U(VI) sorption from aqueous solution,"The renaissance of nuclear energy promotes increasing basic research on the separation and enrichment of nuclear fuel associated radionuclides. Herein, we report the first study for developing mesoporous silica functionalized with phosphonate (NP10) as a sorbent for U(VI) sorption from aqueous solution. The mesoporous silica was synthesized by co-condensation of diethylphosphatoethyltriethoxysilane (DPTS) and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), using cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the template. The synthesized silica nanoparticles were observed to possess a mesoporous structure with a uniform pore diameter of 2.7 nm, and to have good stability and high efficiency for U(VI) sorption from aqueous solution. A maximum sorption capacity of 303 mg g-1 and fast equilibrium time of 30 min were achieved under near neutral conditions at room temperature. The adsorbed U(VI) can be easily desorbed by using 0.1 mol L-1 HNO3, and the reclaimed mesoporous silica can be reused with no decrease of sorption capacity. In addition, the preconcentration of U(VI) from a 100 mL aqueous solution using the functionalized mesoporous silica was also studied. The preconcentration factor was found to be as high as 100, suggesting the vast opportunities of this kind of mesoporous silica for the solid-phase extraction and enrichment of U(VI). © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry."

The nanoprobes are composed of ssDNA and single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and the ssDNA is marked by a dye molecule. In a live cell, trace arsenite ions could interact with nanoprobes and significantly decrease the emission of the nanoprobes.

2011-07-24,Synchrotron radiation and related nuclear analytical techniques for the study on biological effects of nanomaterials,"With the rapid development of nanotechnology, studies on biological effects of nanomaterials have becoming hotspots. However, the fully understanding of fate and toxicological behavior of nanomaterials as a result of interactions with complex biosystem are highly dependent on the reliable analytical techniques. Synchrotron radiation is an advanced light source with notable quality such as high brightness, high level of polarization, high collimation, high brilliance, high intensity and wide tunability in energy/wavelength. It provides particular advantages in elemental mapping and structure characterization of nanomaterials. In this paper, the applications of synchrotron radiation and related nuclear analytical techniques in the studies on the toxicological or biological behaviors of nanomaterials in biological systems are critically reviewed, along with their advantages and limitations. Mentioned techniques include synchrotron radiation X ray fluorescence (SRXRF), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS, XANES and EXAFS), synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectroscopy (SRCD), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), neutron activation analysis (NAA), and isotopic tracing. High throughput quantification of nanomaterials can be achieved by ICP-MS and NAA. The distribution mappings of nanomaterials can be performed by SRXRF and isotopic tracing. Structural characterization can be acquired by XAFS and SRCD. All together, these novel techniques will help to lead a better understanding of the biological effects of nanomaterials."
2011-07-24,Radioanalytical methods in nanotoxicology studies,"With the rapid development of nanotechnology and its applications, the potential interactions of nanomaterials with living systems and environment have attracted increasing attention from the public, manufacturers of nanomaterial-based products, academic researchers and policymakers. Nanotoxicology is emerging as an important subdiscipline of nanotechnology as well as toxicology. Nanotoxicology studies rely on many analytical methods for the characterization of nanomaterials and detection of nanomaterials in living systems. In this case, radioanalytical methods play an important role due to their intrinsic merits such as high sensitivity, good accuracy, ability to distinguish the endogenous or exogenous sources of materials, and ability of in situ and in vivo analysis. This article reviews recent progress of applications of radioanalytical methods in nanotoxicology studies, with emphasis on radiolabeling methods of nanomaterials."

2011-07-21,MCM-41 single crystal of hexagonal circular bicone with pseudo-singular surface and morphogenesis,"The preparation of large MCM-41 single crystals as well as their controllable morphologies has very important meanings not only for their potential applications but also for the exploration of the new morphogenetic mechanism for some special mesoporous crystals. In this paper, a novel crystal form of hexagonal circular bicone of MCM-41 crystal, which is the combination form of thee hexagonal bipyramid and circular bicone forms, has been observed. The MCM-41 single crystals which originally remained the same can grow larger to nearly ∼10 micron via multiple-growth in extremely diluted ammonia solution, and were characterized by SEM, POM, TEM, XRD etc. The morphology of the MCM-41 crystal can also be controllably modulated by adding alkali salts to the synthetic system. Increasing the concentration of KCl can cause the aspect ratio and the conical angle to increase consistently and the result displays monotonicity with a certain statistical deviation. A fluctuation effect has an influence on the surface energy and eventually leads to the evolution from a single crystal to one with non-crystalline characteristics. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011."
2011-07-01,Aerosol characterization and lung deposition of synthesized TiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles for murine inhalation studies,"This study presents a novel exposure protocol for synthesized nanoparticles (NPs). NPs were synthesized in gas phase by thermal decomposition of metal alkoxide vapors in a laminar flow reactor. The exposure protocol was used to estimate the deposition fraction of titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs to mice lung. The experiments were conducted at aerosol mass concentrations of 0.8, 7.2, 10.0, and 28.5 mg m-3. The means of aerosol geometric mobility diameter and aerodynamic diameter were 80 and 124 nm, and the geometric standard deviations were 1.8 and 1.7, respectively. The effective density of the particles was approximately from 1.5 to 1.7 g cm-3. Particle concentration varied from 4 × 105 cm-3 at mass concentrations of 0.8 mg m-3 to 12 × 106 cm -3 at 28.5 mg m-3. Particle phase structures were 74% of anatase and 26% of brookite with respective crystallite sized of 41 and 6 nm. The brookite crystallites were approximately 100 times the size of the anatase crystallites. The TiO2 particles were porous and highly agglomerated, with a mean primary particle size of 21 nm. The specific surface area of TiO2 powder was 61 m2 g-1. We defined mice respiratory minute volume (RMV) value during exposure to TiO2 aerosol. Both TiO2 particulate matter and gaseous by-products affected respiratory parameters. The RMV values were used to quantify the deposition fraction of TiO2 matter by using two different methods. According to individual samples, the deposition fraction was 8% on an average, and when defined from aerosol mass concentration series, it was 7%. These results show that the exposure protocol can be used to study toxicological effects of synthesized NPs. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010."

Chem. Soc.2010, 132, 1261) are open-shell singlets with a polyradical nature instead of closed-shell singlets as originally assumed, according to the unrestricted broken spin-symmetry density functional theory (UBS-DFT) computations (at B3LYP/6-31G). It is the bulky protecting groups, not the transfer from the open-shell singlet to closed-shell singlet ground state, that stabilizes these longest characterized acenes. Similar analyses also confirmed the open-shell singlet character of the hexacene and teranthene derivatives. © 2011 American Chemical Society."

D-GSH-QDs are less cytotoxic than L-GSH-QDs. The ability of QDs to induce cell death is correlated with their ability to induce autophagy, which is chirality-dependent (see picture). © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim."
2011-06-15,Binding modes of thioflavin T molecules to prion peptide assemblies identified by using scanning tunneling microscopy,"The widely used method to monitor the aggregation process of amyloid peptide is thioflavin T (ThT) assay, while the detailed molecular mechanism is still not clear. In this work, we report here the direct identification of the binding modes of ThT molecules with the prion peptide GNNQQNY by using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The assembly structures of GNNQQNY were first observed by STM on a graphite surface, and the introduction of ThT molecules to the surface facilitated the STM observations of the adsorption conformations of ThT with peptide strands. ThT molecules are apt to adsorb on the peptide assembly with β-sheet structure and oriented parallel with the peptide strands adopting four different binding modes. This effort could benefit the understanding of the mechanisms of the interactions between labeling species or inhibitory ligands and amyloid peptides, which is keenly needed for developing diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. © 2011 American Chemical Society."

ECD of SAMs has found applications in biochemical assays and the precise control of cell adhesion. As cell adhesion is controlled by the chemistry of underlying substrate, ECD provides a means to achieve spatiotemporal control of cell behaviors by electrically addressing the substrate. In this minireview, we first introduce the principles of ECD, followed by its applications in dynamically modifying chemistry and biochemistry at the intersurface. Finally, we highlight its applications in cell biology. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
2011-06-10,Endothelial dysfunction and inflammation induced by iron oxide nanoparticle exposure: Risk factors for early atherosclerosis,"More recently, the correlation between exposure to nanoparticles and cardiovascular diseases is of particular concern in nanotoxicology related fields. Nanoparticle-triggered endothelial dysfunction is hypothesized to be a dominant mechanism in the development of the diseases. To test this hypothesis, iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe 2O 3 and Fe 3O 4), as two widely used nanomaterials and the main metallic components in particulate matter, were selected to assess their potential risks on human endothelial system. The direct effects of iron oxide nanoparticles on human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) and the possible effects mediated by monocyte (U937 cells) phagocytosis and activation were investigated. In the study, HAECs and U937 cells were exposed to 2, 20, 100μg/mL of 22-nm-Fe 2O 3 and 43-nm-Fe 3O 4 particles. Our results indicate that cytoplasmic vacuolation, mitochondrial swelling and cell death were induced in HAEC. A significant increase in nitric oxide (NO) production was induced which coincided with the elevation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in HAECs. Adhesion of monocytes to the HAECs was significantly enhanced as a consequence of the up-regulation of intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression, all of which are considered as early steps of atheroscelerosis. Phagocytosis and dissolution of nanoparticles by monocytes were found to simultaneously provoke oxidative stress and mediate severe endothelial toxicity. We conclude that intravascular iron oxide nanoparticles may induce endothelial system inflammation and dysfunction by three ways: (1) nanoparticles may escape from phagocytosis that interact directly with the endothelial monolayer; (2) nanoparticles are phagocytized by monocytes and then dissolved, thus impact the endothelial cells as free iron ions; or (3) nanoparticles are phagocytized by monocytes to provoke oxidative stress responses. © 2011."

Toxicity studies of the nanoparticle have shown some evidence of low or non toxicity in mice and cell models. Here we employed Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as a model organism to further evaluate the short- and long-term toxicity of Gd@C82(OH)22 and possible behavior changes under normal and stress culture conditions. With treatment of Gd@C82(OH)22 at 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 10 μg ml−1 within one generation (short-term), C. elegans showed no significant decrease in longevity or thermotolerance compared to the controls. Furthermore, when Gd@C82(OH)22 treatment was extended up to six generations (long-term), non-toxic effects to the nematodes were found. In addition, data from body length measurement, feeding rate and egg-laying assays with short-term treatment demonstrated that the nanoparticles have no significant impact on the individual growth, feeding behavior and reproductive ability, respectively. In summary, this work has shown that Gd@C82(OH)22 is tolerated well by worms and it has no apparent toxic effects on longevity, stress resistance, growth and behaviors that were observed in both adult and young worms. Our work lays the foundations for further developments of this anti-neoplastic agent for clinical applications. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry."
2011-06-08,Controlling assembly of paired gold clusters within apoferritin nanoreactor for in vivo kidney targeting and biomedical imaging,"Functional nanostructures with high biocompatibility and stability, low toxicity, and specificity of targeting to desired organs or cells are of great interest in nanobiology and medicine. However, the challenge is to integrate all of these desired features into a single nanobiostructure, which can be applied to biomedical applications and eventually in clinical settings. In this context, we designed a strategy to assemble two gold nanoclusters at the ferroxidase active sites of ferritin heavy chain. Our studies showed that the resulting nanostructures (Au-Ft) retain not only the intrinsic fluorescence properties of noble metal, but gain enhanced intensity, show a red-shift, and exhibit tunable emissions due to the coupling interaction between the paired Au clusters. Furthermore, Au-Ft possessed the well-defined nanostructure of native ferritin, showed organ-specific targeting ability, high biocompatibility, and low cytotoxicity. The current study demonstrates that an integrated multimodal assembly strategy is able to generate stable and effective biomolecule-noble metal complexes of controllable size and with desirable fluorescence emission characteristics. Such agents are ideal for targeted in vitro and in vivo imaging. These results thus open new opportunities for biomolecule-guided nanostructure assembly with great potential for biomedical applications. © 2011 American Chemical Society."
2011-06-01,Design of smart nanomaterials for drug and gene delivery,"The design of stimuli-responsive nanomaterials intended for specific applications in biomedicine implies the presence of different moieties that allow targeting, imaging, therapy and controlled release of active molecules in the same system. Functionalization of material surfaces and nanotechnology are valuable tools that enable a multifunctional approach to address these aims. Recent research examples for applications in biomedicine such as drug and gene delivery will be tackled in this thematic review. Magnetic nanoparticles are one of the clearest examples of the multifunctional character of nanosystems. Diversity of uses and the possibility to combine them in multimodal therapies give them a privileged place among the new designs. We will discuss the recent advances in the development of smart drug delivery nanodevices. The dosage control through surface functionalization of inorganic nanoparticles with macromolecules able to change their properties or perform self-recognition processes under the application of an external stimulus will be addressed. Moreover, functionalized bioceramics have been assessed as nonviral vectors for in vitro gene transfection. The key processes involved in the design of this kind of mediators to assist the transport of DNA fragments from the extracellular environment to the cell nucleus will be examined. In particular, the covalent bonding of dendrimers to magnetic nanoparticles provides a useful approach aimed at reducing transfection times. The application of these systems represents an invaluable strategy in the field of genetic engineering. © 2011 American Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved."
2011-06-01,Homogeneous dispersion of gadolinium oxide nanoparticles into a non-aqueous-based polymer by two surface treatments,"Gadolinium oxide nanoparticles are more and more used. They can notably provide interesting fluorescence properties. Herein they are incorporated into a non-aqueous-based polymer, the poly(methyl methacrylate). Their dispersion within the polymer matrix is the key to improve the composite properties. As-received gadolinium oxide nanopowders cannot be homogeneously dispersed in such a polymer matrix. Two surface treatments are, therefore, detailed and compared to achieve a good stability of the nanoparticles in a non-aqueous solvent such as the 2-butanone. Then, once the liquid suspensions have been stabilized, they are used to prepare nanocomposites with homogeneous particles dispersion. The two approaches proposed are an hybrid approach based on the growth of a silica shell around the gadolinium oxide nanoparticles, and followed by a suitable silane functionalization; and a non-hybrid approach based on the use of surfactants. The surface treatments and formulations involved in both methods are detailed, adjusted and compared. Thanks to optical methods and in particular to the use of a 'home made' confocal microscope, the dispersion homogeneity within the polymer can be assessed. Both methods provide promising and conclusive results. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010."

The knowledge about GNPs interacting with cells is quite limited and however, is necessary for risk prediction and evaluation of biological effects. Herein, we review recent advances in cellular effects of GNPs including cellular uptake, trafficking, subcellular distribution and cellular responses, and the relationship between physiochemical properties of GNPs and biological effects as well. To uncover these issues, it is quite instructive for safe and sustainable use of GNPs."
2011-06-01,Distribution of CdSe@ZnS QDs in adult drosophila and their stage-1 larva,"In this work, CdSe@ZnS quantum dots (QDs) distributed in the QDs-exposed adult drosophila and their stage-1 larva were characterized by synchrotron radiation micro X-ray fluorescence (u-SRXRF) and laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM), respectively. The CdSe@ZnS QDs were exposed via the mouth to the adult drosophila. The u-SRXRF elemental mapping of Cd, Se and Zn revealed that the elements were concentrated in the intestinal and reproductive system, indicating that QDs could accumulate in the intestinal and reproductive system. Obvious fluorescence signals were observed in the testis of stage-1 larva by LSCM technique. The results indicate the QDs via oral exposure could induce potential impact on placenta translocation and reproductive system. The results show that μ-SRXRF analysis is a novel method for the investigation of translocation of nanoparticle in the living organism."

2011-06-01,Distribution of silver in rats following 28 days of repeated oral exposure to silver nanoparticles or silver acetate,"Background: The study investigated the distribution of silver after 28 days repeated oral administration of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and silver acetate (AgAc) to rats. Oral administration is a relevant route of exposure because of the use of silver nanoparticles in products related to food and food contact materials.Results: AgNPs were synthesized with a size distribution of 14 ± 4 nm in diameter (90% of the nanoparticle volume) and stabilized in aqueous suspension by the polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The AgNPs remained stable throughout the duration of the 28-day oral toxicity study in rats. The organ distribution pattern of silver following administration of AgNPs and AgAc was similar. However the absolute silver concentrations in tissues were lower following oral exposure to AgNPs. This was in agreement with an indication of a higher fecal excretion following administration of AgNPs. Besides the intestinal system, the largest silver concentrations were detected in the liver and kidneys. Silver was also found in the lungs and brain. Autometallographic (AMG) staining revealed a similar cellular localization of silver in ileum, liver, and kidney tissue in rats exposed to AgNPs or AgAc.Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanosized granules were detected in the ileum of animals exposed to AgNPs or AgAc and were mainly located in the basal lamina of the ileal epithelium and in lysosomes of macrophages within the lamina propria. Using energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy it was shown that the granules in lysosomes consisted of silver, selenium, and sulfur for both AgNP and AgAc exposed rats. The diameter of the deposited granules was in the same size range as that of the administered AgNPs. No silver granules were detected by TEM in the liver.Conclusions: The results of the present study demonstrate that the organ distribution of silver was similar when AgNPs or AgAc were administered orally to rats. The presence of silver granules containing selenium and sulfur in the intestinal wall of rats exposed to either of the silver forms suggests a common mechanism of their formation. Additional studies however, are needed to gain further insight into the underlying mechanisms of the granule formation, and to clarify whether AgNPs dissolve in the gastrointestinal system and/or become absorbed and translocate as intact nanoparticles to organs and tissues. © 2011 Loeschner et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."
2011-06-01,"Ternary complexes of amphiphilic polycaprolactone-graft-poly (N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate), DNA and polyglutamic acid-graft-poly(ethylene glycol) for gene delivery","Binary complexes of cationic polymers and DNA were used commonly for DNA delivery, whereas, the excess cationic charge of the binary complexes mainly leads to high toxicity and unstability in vivo. In this paper, ternary complexes by coating polyglutamic acid-graft-poly(ethylene glycol)(PGA-g-mPEG) onto binary complexes of polycaprolactone-graft-poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PCL-g-PDMAEMA) nanoparticles (NPs)/DNA were firstly developed for effective and targeted gene delivery. The coating of PGA-g-mPEG was able to decrease the zeta potential of the nano-sized DNA complexes nearly to electroneutrality without interferring with DNA condensation ability. As a result, the stability, the escape ability from endosomes and the transfection efficiency of the complexes were enhanced. The ternary complexes of PCL-g-PDMAEMA NPs/DNA/PGA-g-mPEG demonstrated lower cytotoxicity in CCK-8 measurements and higher gene transfection efficiency than the binary complexes in vitro. In addition, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was performed to quantify the membrane-damaging effects of the complexes, which is consistent with the conclusion of CCK-8 measurement for cytotoxicity assay. The in vivo imaging measurement and histochemical analysis of tumor sessions confirmed that the intravenous administration of the ternary complexes with red fluorescent protein (RFP) as payload led to protein expression in tumor, which was further enhanced by the targeted coating of PGA-g-PEG-folate. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."
2011-06-01,The inhibition of death receptor mediated apoptosis through lysosome stabilization following internalization of carboxyfullerene nanoparticles,"Cells undergo apoptosis through two major pathways, the extrinsic pathway (death receptor pathway) and the intrinsic pathway (the mitochondrial pathway). It is well known that nanomaterials of water- soluble fullerene derivatives are potent antioxidants and help to prevent the overproduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, whether their interaction with cells via the death receptor pathway is direct or indirect remains poorly understood. Here, we show that a bis-adduct malonic acid derivative of fullerene, C60(C(COOH)2)2, inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha-initiated cellular apoptosis via stabilizing lysosomes. Data presented here demonstrate that nano-sized aggregates of this water-soluble fullerene derivative are endocytosed into cells and enriched in the lysosomes. During the internalization of C60(C(COOH)2)2, the expression of Hsp 70 is significantly upregulated, promoting cell survival by inhibiting the permeabilization of lysosomal membranes. In addition, the acidic environment inside lysosomes has a marked but temporary effect on the size distribution of fullerenic nanoparticles, and may disperse the aggregated C60(C(COOH)2)2 nanoparticles into single molecules or smaller aggregates. These single molecules or smaller aggregates may insert into the lysosomal membranes, further stabilizing them and decreasing the release of cathepsins from lysosomes, leading to the inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis. C60(C(COOH)2)2 nanoparticles can thus protect cells by stabilizing lysosomal membranes via both upregulated expression of Hsp 70 and by their interactions with lysosomal membranes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."
2011-06-01,Aligned carbon nanotube-reinforced silicon carbide composites produced by chemical vapor infiltration,"A chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) technique was used to overcome most of the challenges involved in fabricating exceptionally-tough CNT/SiC composites. Nanotube pullout and sequential breaking and slippage of the walls of the CNTs during failure were consistently observed for all fractured CNT/SiC samples. These energy absorbing mechanisms result in the fracture strength of the CNT/SiC composites about an order of magnitude higher than the bulk SiC. The CVI-fabricated CNT/SiC composites have an strongly-bonded tube/matrix interface and an amorphous, crack-free SiC matrix, enabling the composites to withstand oxidization at 700-1600 °C in air. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

2011-05-23,"Cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking, and cytotoxicity of nanomaterials","The interactions of nanoparticles with the soft surfaces of biological systems like cells play key roles in executing their biomedical functions and in toxicity. The discovery or design of new biomedical functions, or the prediction of the toxicological consequences of nanoparticles in vivo, first require knowledge of the interplay processes of the nanoparticles with the target cells. This article focusses on the cellular uptake, location and translocation, and any biological consequences, such as cytotoxicity, of the most widely studied and used nanoparticles, such as carbon-based nanoparticles, metallic nanoparticles, and quantum dots. The relevance of the size and shape, composition, charge, and surface chemistry of the nanoparticles in cells is considered. The intracellular uptake pathways of the nanoparticles and the cellular responses, with potential signaling pathways activated by nanoparticle interactions, are also discussed.

The amphiphilic copolymer may self-assemble into polymeric micelles in an aqueous solution. Fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and a transmission electron microscope (TEM) method confirmed the formation of copolymeric micelles. To estimate the feasibility as novel drug carriers, doxorubicin (DOX) was incorporated into polymeric nanoparticles. The DOX-loaded nanoparticles exhibited greater antitumor effect than free DOX for HeLa celles, suggesting that the dextran/DPPE nanoparticles have great potential as a tumor targeting drug carrier. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
2011-05-04,Control of energy and matter at nanoscales: Challenges and opportunities for plasma nanoscience in a sustainability age,"Plasma nanoscience is an emerging multidisciplinary research field at the cutting edge of a large number of disciplines including but not limited to physics and chemistry of plasmas and gas discharges, materials science, surface science, nanoscience and nanotechnology, solid-state physics, space physics and astrophysics, photonics, optics, plasmonics, spintronics, quantum information, physical chemistry, biomedical sciences and related engineering subjects. This paper examines the origin, progress and future perspectives of this research field driven by the global scientific and societal challenges. The future potential of plasma nanoscience to remain a highly topical area in the global research and technological agenda in the age of fundamental-level control for a sustainable future is assessed using a framework of the five Grand Challenges for Basic Energy Sciences recently mapped by the US Department of Energy. It is concluded that the ongoing research is very relevant and is expected to substantially expand to competitively contribute to the solution of all of these Grand Challenges. The approach to controlling energy and matter at nano- and subnanoscales is based on identifying the prevailing carriers and transfer mechanisms of the energy and matter at the spatial and temporal scales that are most relevant to any particular nanofabrication process. Strong accent is made on the competitive edge of the plasma-based nanotechnology in applications related to the major socio-economic issues (energy, food, water, health and environment) that are crucial for a sustainable development of humankind. Several important emerging topics, opportunities and multidisciplinary synergies for plasma nanoscience are highlighted. The main nanosafety issues are also discussed and the environment- and human health-friendly features of plasma-based nanotech are emphasized. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd."
2011-05-01,Comparison study on the antibacterial activity of nano-or bulk-cerium oxide,"Due to the unique physical and chemical properties, nanosized cerium oxide (n-CeO 2) has attracted considerable interest in many fields of research. The potential, the growing use and the mass production of n-CeO 2 have stimulated research on their potential impact on the environment and human health. However, the toxicological definition for CeO 2 nanoparticles (NPs) is still quite controversial. In the present work, we evaluated the antibacterial activity of CeO 2 NPs sized ca. 7 nm (7-CeO 2), ca. 25 nm (25-CeO 2) and their bulk counterpart (b-CeO 2), using gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli). Our results suggest that all the three types of CeO 2 particles have antibacterial activity, and both the NPs are more toxic than b-CeO 2. The rise in intracellular ROS level induced by direct contact of particles with the surface of E. coli was involved in the mechanism for the antibacterial activity of CeO 2 NPs. Exposure to 25-CeO 2 could also impair the integrity of the outer membrane within E. coli cells. Due to agglomeration and negligible effect on membrane integrity, 7-CeO 2 did not exhibit greater antibacterial activity than 25-CeO 2.

2011-05-01,"Preparation, characterization and SRXPS study of polyvinyl alcohol modified Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> nanoparticles","In this study, Fe3O4 nanoparticles were coated with PVA to synthesize PVA- Fe3O4 complex, which were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermo gravimetric (TG) analysis, UV-vis spectra, zeta potentials and ICP-MS, in terms of the physicochemical properties, while surface constituents, structures and chemical bonds of the modified and unmodified nanoparticles were characterized with synchrotron radiation X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SRXPS), for exploring modification mechanism of the PVA- Fe3O4. The results indicate that after PVA modification, the suspension stability of Fe3O4 nanoparticles in water and cellular uptake capability were significantly improved compared with unmodified Fe3O4. The SRXPS analysis reveals that the hydroxy groups on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and PVA were combined by hydrogen bond to consist a stable system, which would be beneficial to the biomedical applications of Fe3O4 nanoparticles."

2011-05-01,Magnetite (Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>) nanocrystals affect the expression of genes involved in the TGF-beta signalling pathway,"An understanding of interaction of nanomaterials with living systems is fundamental to address nanosafety issues, which, in turn will dictate the future prospects of nanomedicine. Herein, we examine the molecular effects of uptake of Magnetite (Fe3O4) Nanocrystals (MNC) using a transcriptomics approach. The uptake of MNC was studied by electron microscopy. This was followed by transcriptional profiling using whole genome microarrays, functional analysis of microarray data, real time PCR and biochemical assay for CASP9. Transcriptional profiling revealed 69 genes to be differentially expressed upon MNC treatment. Many of these genes are associated with TGF-beta signaling and include ID1, ID2, ID3, CASP9, SMAD6 and SMAD7, which are important negative regulators of signaling pathways involved in development and tumorigenesis. Moreover, upon treatment with MNC, expression of CASP9 was also found to decrease in a dose dependent manner. This approach could help us to identify specific effects of MNC upon cells and give us simultaneous clues about their biocompatibility and therapeutic potential. The MNC can specifically interfere with TGF-beta signaling by inhibiting the expression of ID and SMAD genes. As TGF-beta signaling invokes different responses in undifferentiated cells and adult tissues in a cell-type specific manner, our findings have far reaching implications in cellular development, differentiation and cancer. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011."
2011-04-26,Cinnabar is not converted into methylmercury by human intestinal bacteria,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Cinnabar (Cin), a naturally occurring mercuric sulfide (HgS), is a mineral widely used in traditional Chinese medicine throughout history. As for the toxicity of cinnabar, one important assumption is that cinnabar may be transformed into highly toxic methylmercury by gastrointestinal flora. There is no evidence in humans to support this assumption. Aim of the study: To investigate the biotransformation of cinnabar (HgS) in the human intestinal bacteria with modern analytical techniques. Materials and methods: A gas chromatograph, equipped with electron capture detection (GC-ECD) and mass spectrometry (GC-MS), were used to detect the formation of methylmercury after incubation of cinnabar with human intestinal bacteria. The content of soluble mercury in the bacteria media was determined by cold vapor-atomic absorption spectrometry (CV-AAS). In addition, X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) was used to confirm the possible transformation of cinnabar in the bacteria media, and under mimetic intestinal condition by measuring the species of sulfur and mercury in the reaction extraction of cinnabar and Na 2S mixture. Results: No methylmercury was detected by both GC-ECD and GC-MS, which suggest that cinnabar (HgS) is not methylated in the human intestine. A small amount of soluble mercury was found to be released in the flora medium of HgS or cinnabar by CV-AAS. The XANES analyses revealed that polysulfides exist in the flora medium, and the simulated results showed that the products by incubating cinnabar with Na 2S were mercuric polysulfides. Conclusion: These results showed that under gut flora conditions cinnabar would be transformed into mercuric polysulfides rather than methylmercury. Our work provides evidences of nontoxic transformation of cinnabar in the human intestinal bacteria. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

2011-04-15,Nano-CeO<inf>2</inf> exhibits adverse effects at environmental relevant concentrations,"Ceria nanoparticles (nano-CeO2), due to their widespread applications, have attracted a lot of concern about their toxic effects on both human health and the environment. The present work aimed to evaluate the in vivo effects of nano-CeO2 (8.5 nm) on Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) at environmental relevant concentrations (molar concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 100 nM). The results indicate that nano-CeO2 could induce ROS accumulation and oxidative damage in C. elegans, and finally lead to a decreased lifespan. The most surprising thing is that the mean lifespan of nematodes was significantly decreased by 12% even at the exposure level of 1 nM (p < 0.01). In vitro tests suggest that the ability of nano-CeO2 to catalyze ROS generation was involved in the mechanism for its toxicity to C. elegans. To our best knowledge, this is the first case in which nanoparticles exhibit adverse effects on organisms at such low concentrations (1nM-100 nM). So, our findings indicate the importance of nanotoxicological investigations at environmentally relevant concentrations and will attract more attentions on the risks of NPs exposure. © 2011 American Chemical Society."

STM images showed that the lattice structure of the underlying metal substrates affected the arrangement of the metallofullerene molecules. Preferred adsorption orientations of the molecules were found from STM images with submolecular resolution. Differences in the scanning tunneling spectroscopy of molecules adsorbed on Cu(111) and Cu(100) were observed and attributed to the work function difference between the substrates. In addition, the electronic properties of the fullerene monomer, dimer, and monolayer were characterized and compared, revealing the roles played by the molecule-substrate interaction and the intermolecular interaction. © 2011 American Chemical Society."

It has characteristics of low cost, easy operation, high sensitivity, multinomial toxic index record, and etc. In the present study, aquatic toxic effects of rare earth element gadolinium were evaluated by observing the embryonic development of fertilized zebrafish eggs. The toxicological endpoints, including hatch rates at 72 h, larvae mortality, body length and the medium lethal concentration (LC50) at 96 h, were investigated at 0, 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 mmol · L-1 GaCl3. The results showed that there was no toxic effect at the concentrations lower than 0.005 mmol · L-1. However, at higher concentrations, negative effects were observed, and Gd3+ significantly inhibited embryonic development of zebrafish."
2011-04-01,Dynamic oversight: Implementation gaps and challenges,"Nanotechnology is touted as a transformative technology in that it is predicted to improve many aspects of human life. There are hundreds of products in the market that utilize nanostructures in their design, such as composite materials made out of carbon or metal oxides. Potential risks to consumers, to the environment, and to workers from the most common passive nanomaterial - carbon nanotubes - are emerging through scientific research. Newer more active nanostructures - such as cancer therapies and targeted drug systems - are also increasing in use and are raising similar risk concerns. Governing the risks to workers is the subject of this commentary. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 grants the Occupational Safety and Health Administration the legal authority to set occupational health standards to insure that no worker suffers material impairment of health from work. However, setting a standard to protect workers from nanotechnology risks may occur some time in the future because the risks to workers have not been well characterized scientifically. Alternative risk governances - such as dynamic oversight through stakeholder partnerships, ""soft law"" approaches, and national adoption of international consensus standards - are evaluated in this article. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

2011-03-31,"Engineered nanomaterials: Exposures, hazards, and risk prevention","Nanotechnology presents the possibility of revolutionizing many aspects of our lives. People in many settings (academic, small and large industrial, and the general public in industrialized nations) are either developing or using engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) or ENM-containing products. However, our understanding of the occupational, health and safety aspects of ENMs is still in its formative stage. A survey of the literature indicates the available information is incomplete, many of the early findings have not been independently verified, and some may have been over-interpreted. This review describes ENMs briefly, their application, the ENM workforce, the major routes of human exposure, some examples of uptake and adverse effects, what little has been reported on occupational exposure assessment, and approaches to minimize exposure and health hazards. These latter approaches include engineering controls such as fume hoods and personal protective equipment. Results showing the effectiveness - or lack thereof - of some of these controls are also included. This review is presented in the context of the Risk Assessment/Risk Management framework, as a paradigm to systematically work through issues regarding human health hazards of ENMs. Examples are discussed of current knowledge of nanoscale materials for each component of the Risk Assessment/Risk Management framework. Given the notable lack of information, current recommendations to minimize exposure and hazards are largely based on common sense, knowledge by analogy to ultrafine material toxicity, and general health and safety recommendations. This review may serve as an overview for health and safety personnel, management, and ENM workers to establish and maintain a safe work environment. Small start-up companies and research institutions with limited personnel or expertise in nanotechnology health and safety issues may find this review particularly useful. © 2011 Yokel and MacPhail."

2011-03-01,Significance and systematic analysis of metallic impurities of carbon nanotubes produced by different manufacturers,"Commercially available carbon nanotubes (CNT) often contain some quantities of metallic and carbonaceous impurities. These impurities influence their physicochemical properties and performance, and accordingly a number of potential applications. The lack of information of metal impurities may also preclude accurate environmental and health risk assessments for specific CNT materials. To address these needs, a quantitative analysis of the metal contents has been made in a number of commercial carbon nanotubes produced by different manufacturers. More than 20 metals or metalloids were determined by neutron activation analysis. The results indicate arranging from 0.44 to 3 wt% of catalyst residues remained although the producers claim to provide a catalyst-free product. Most of the impurity elements are transition metals, such as Fe, Ni, Mo, Y, Co and Cr. In addition to the expected catalyst residues, other unexpected impurity elements were detected including As, Gd, W, Yb, Sm and so on. Metallic impurities in carbon nanotube materials should come from the large-scale production procedures, post fabrication and post-purification treatments. The analytical results determined by inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry show that a further deep purification using conventional acid reflux cannot completely remove the metallic impurities from carbon nanotubes. Post-production clean up is difficult and often incompletely. © 2011 American Scientific Publishers."

Obvious differences in cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking, and susceptibility of lysosome to Au NRs by different types of cells resulted in selective accumulation of Au NRs in the mitochondria of cancer cells. Their long-term retention decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased reactive oxygen species level that enhances the likelihood of cell death. These findings thus provide guidance for the design of organelle-targeted nanomaterials in tumor therapy. © 2010 American Chemical Society."
2011-02-01,Predicting viruses accurately by a multiplex microfluidic loop-mediated isothermal amplification chip,"Multiplex gene assay is a valuable molecular tool not only in academic science but also in clinical diagnostics. Multiplex PCR assays, DNA microarrays, and various nanotechnology-based methods are examples of major techniques developed for analyzing multiple genes; none of these, however, are suitable for point-of-care diagnostics, especially in resource-limited settings. In this report, we describe an octopus-like multiplex microfluidic loop-mediated isothermal amplification (mμLAMP) assay for the rapid analysis of multiple genes in the point-of-care format and provide a robust approach for predicting viruses. This assay with the ability of analyzing multiple genes qualitatively and quantitatively is highly specific, operationally simple, and cost/timeeffective with the detection limit of less than 10 copies/μL in 2 μL quantities of sample within 0.5 h.

2011-02-01,"Low-toxic and safe nanomaterials by surface-chemical design, carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, metallofullerenes, and graphenes","The toxicity grade for a bulk material can be approximately determined by three factors (chemical composition, dose, and exposure route). However, for a nanomaterial it depends on more than ten factors. Interestingly, some nano-factors (like huge surface adsorbability, small size, etc.) that endow nanomaterials with new biomedical functions are also potential causes leading to toxicity or damage to the living organism. Is it possible to create safe nanomaterials if such a number of complicated factors need to be regulated? We herein try to find answers to this important question. We first discuss chemical processes that are applicable for nanosurface modifications, in order to improve biocompatibility, regulate ADME, and reduce the toxicity of carbon nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, metallofullerenes, and graphenes). Then the biological/toxicological effects of surface-modified and unmodified carbon nanomaterials are comparatively discussed from two aspects: the lowered toxic responses or the enhanced biomedical functions. We summarize the eight biggest challenges in creating low-toxicity and safer nanomaterials and some significant topics of future research needs: to find out safer nanofactors; to establish controllable surface modifications and simpler chemistries for low-toxic nanomaterials; to explore the nanotoxicity mechanisms; to justify the validity of current toxicological theories in nanotoxicology; to create standardized nanomaterials for toxicity tests; to build theoretical models for cellular and molecular interactions of nanoparticles; and to establish systematical knowledge frameworks for nanotoxicology. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry."
2011-02-01,Development of nanosafety forecasting system from the viewpoint of nanomaterial-protein interaction,"With recent developments in nanotechnology, nanomaterials have been successfully employed in various industrial applications such as medicine and cosmetics. Nanomaterials demonstrate useful properties such as electronic reactivity and tissue permeability that are absent in micromaterials. Thus, it is anticipated that nanomaterials will be developed as innovative materials in medicine and the cosmetics industry. However, these innovative properties may be accompanied by unknown biological responses that could not have been detected by conventional toxicity assays. To promote industrial development and to establish an aOEuent society that enjoys only the benefits of nanomaterials, we urgently need to gather information on the properties and biological effects of nanomaterials, and to establish appropriate standard safety evaluation methods. We are therefore analyzing the association of nanomaterial interactions with macromolecules (proteins, DNA etc.) and biodistribution using nanosilicas (nSP) as a standard nanomaterial. The results of this study are useful for extrapolation to other nanomaterials and to establish practicable strategies for the development of prediction methods for nanomaterials. © 2011 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan."
2011-02-01,Transdermal penetration and biodistribution of nanomaterials and their acute toxicity in vivo,"Recently, the number of applications of nanomaterials in medicine, cosmetics and food to which we are directly exposed has been expanding rapidly. The safety of such nanomaterials has not been well assessed, because nanomaterials have been considered as safe as common larger sized materials which are known not to be absorbed by the body. Therefore, WHO and OECD are collecting safety information on nanomaterials with a view to regulation of their use. Although assessment of in vivo behaviors of nanomaterials, (i.e., absorption and distribution, and correlation analysis with hazard information) is urgently needed, such research has not yet been undertaken. In this regard, using amorphous silica particles as model nanomaterials, we are starting to study safety, in vivo behavior and their correlation; silica particles are often used in cosmetics and foods and also, downsized particles are rapidly becoming available. In our study, we have found that silica particles below 100 nm in diameter show significantly different characteristics in in vivo behavior and biological effects i.e., penetration through skin and distribution to brain. Here, I addressed the importance of studies in physicochemical characteristics, kinetic behaviors, and biological effects of nanomaterials below 100 nm in size, to ensure their safety. © 2011 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan."
2011-02-01,Nanosafety studies of nanomaterials about biodistribution and immunotoxicity,"A diverse array of nanomaterials such as nanosilicas and carbon nanotubes are in widespread use due to the development of nanotechnology. Nanomaterials are already being applied in universal fields such as electronics, sunscreens, cosmetics, and medicine, because they have unique physicochemical properties such as high conductivity, strength, durability, and chemical reactivity. The advent of nanomaterials has also provided extraordinary opportunities for biomedical applications. However, the increasing use of nanomaterials has raised public concern about their potential risks to human health. In particular, recent reports have indicated that carbon nanotubes induced exaggerated inflammation and mesothelioma-like lesions in mice. However, few studies have examined the immunotoxicity of nanomaterials and it is essential to progress studies on the immunotoxicity of nanomaterials to ensure their safety. In this regard, we have attempted to elucidate the pharmacodynamics and immunotoxicity of nanomaterials, in order to develop novel safe nanomaterials and to establish scientifically based regulations. In this review, we would like to introduce our data on the immunotoxicity of nanosilicas, especially the relationship between physical properties (primary grain size, configuration and surface charge), pharmacodynamics of these materials, and their immunotoxicity. We consider that our study will improve the quality of human life by safely using nanomaterials, which can benefit society in general. © 2011 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan."
2011-02-01,Safety studies of nanomaterials about intracellular distribution and genotoxicity,"Recently, nanomaterials (NMs) showing useful properties such as controlled release and tissue permeability have been developed for practical use as medicine and cosmetics. On the other hand, because NMs possess innovative properties, kinetics, and biological effects distinct from those of micro size bulk materials, the potential harmful effects of NMs on humans are raising concerns about their safety. Therefore, there is an urgent need for risk assessment of NMs. To achieve this, it is most important to analyze the relationship between physicochemical properties such as particle size and surface characteristics, cellular distribution and biological effects, allowing prediction and avoidance of risk in using NMs. However there is little information about association of nanomaterial properties with kinetics (exposure, absorption, distribution, and excretion). In this respect, we have not only collected hazard information on NMs but have also analyzed the linkage between silica particle size and their hazards. We have demonstrated that NM with a diameter of under 100 nm can penetrate the stratum corneum of mouse skin and are taken up by living cells such as keratinocytes and Langerhans cells. Additionally, NM taken up by cells entered the nucleus, indicating the risk of genotoxicity. In this review, we would like to discuss the relationship between particle size, intracellular distribution, and hazard effect. © 2011 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan."
2011-02-01,Direct evidence for catalase and peroxidase activities of ferritin-platinum nanoparticles,"Using apoferritin (apoFt) as a nucleation substrate, we have successfully synthesized 1-2 nm platinum nanoparticles (Pt-Ft) which are highly stable. By directly measuring the products of Pt-Ft-catalyzed reactions, we showed, with no doubt, Pt-Ft possesses both catalase and peroxidase activities. With hydrogen peroxide as substrate, we observed oxygen gas bubbles were generated from hydrogen peroxide decomposed by Pt-Ft; the generation of oxygen gas strongly supports Pt-Ft reacts as catalase, other than peroxidase. While with organic dyes and hydrogen peroxide as substrates, distinctive color products were formed catalyzed by Pt-Ft, which indicates a peroxidase-like activity. Interestingly, these biomimetic properties showed differential response to pH and temperature for different reaction substrates. Pt-Ft showed a significant increase in catalase activity with increasing pH and temperature. The HRP-like activity of Pt-Ft was optimal at physiological temperature and slightly acidic conditions. Our current study demonstrates that Pt-Ft possesses both catalase and peroxidase activities for different substrates under different conditions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."
2011-02-01,Au@Pt nanostructures as oxidase and peroxidase mimetics for use in immunoassays,"In this paper, we demonstrated that Au nanorods coated with a shell composed of Pt nanodots (Au@Pt nanostructures) exhibited intrinsic oxidase-like, peroxidase-like and catalase-like activity, catalyzing oxygen and hydrogen peroxide reduction and the dismutation decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to produce oxygen. Based on these findings, we established an Au@Pt nanostructures based enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of mouse interleukin 2 (IL-2). In comparison with natural enzymes, Au@Pt nanostructures have advantages of low cost, easy preparation, better stability, and tunable catalytic activity (compared with HRP), which make them a promising enzyme mimetic candidate and may find potential applications in biocatalysis, bioassays, and nano-biomedicine such as reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related fields (anti-aging and therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases and cancers). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."

Specific national nanoregulations and risk management systems are introduced there. The most active countries in nanotechnology governance are in Europe Germany, Great Britain, France, The Netherlands and Swiss and also Austria, Norway and Finland. Beyond Europe the leading role in this respect play USA, Canada and Australia. The presentation will provide a brief overview of how the mentioned countries govern the development of nanotechnologies with the aim of avoiding potential risks associated with them and define adequate regulations and risk management structures with reference to both EHS (Environment, Health and Safety) issues and ELSA (Ethical, Legal and Social) aspects. Experiences of these countries may provide a model for the Czech Republic."
2011-01-01,The politics of bioethics,"Recent rapid advances in the biosciences have led to considerable debate about the social, ethical, and legal implications of research and its applications. The mapping of the human genome, advances in cloning techniques, the harvesting of embryonic stem cells for research, increasing use of genetic testing in healthcare, and the development of large-scale genetic databases have not only generated high expectations about new diagnostics and treatments but also considerable widespread fear about their consequences. This book offers a critical appraisal of bioethics and its implications as it pertains to the fields of health and medicine and public health, with a particular emphasis on recent technological innovations as they provide a noteworthy exemplar of the power of bioethics in shaping policies, practices and notions of societal benefits. Whereas other books have tended to examine ethical dilemmas and challenges of applying ethical principles, often in relation to a limited array of issues, this book investigates the socio-political implications of bioethics discourse and practices in relation to a range of controversial (or potentially controversial) developments. Providing a benchmark for future debate and scholarly work, this volume will be of interest to policymakers, clinicians, scholars, and others who are looking for new ways of making sense and evaluating recent developments in the field of bioethics."
2011-01-01,Biological effects of silver nanoparticles,"Silver nanoparticles are widely used now for the creation and production of modified materials with special properties. However, the mode of their action on the living organisms and the conditions providing the safety of their applications for humans and other living beings remain poorly understood. Therefore, of particular interest are studies allowing to reveal the effects of nanoparticles ' parameters on various functions of the biological systems and, in particular, to determine the concentration limits within which the nanoparticles are not toxic for a given plant, animal or human organism.. This chapter presents a review on the biological effects of silver nanoparticles observed in experiments on the living organisms of various types. The nanoparticles used in these studies were obtained by the original method of biochemical synthesis, based on the reduction of metal ions by natural plant pigments (flavonoids) in reverse micelles formed by the anionic surfactant. From micellar solutions of nanoparticles in organic solvent water dispersions are prepared according to the special procedure. Optical spectra and TEM micrographs of silver nanoparticles in solutions are presented. Both water solutions containing silver nanoparticles and solid or polymer materials modified by the nanoparticles are considered. The antimicrobial properties and toxic action of the nanoparticles on slim mold, alga, plant seeds and animals are described. The results are compared with those reported in similar studies using silver nanoparticles obtained by the other methods. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

The large-scale in vivo genotoxicity testing of the various nanomaterials does not seem realistic. Information on nanoparticle characteristics associated with genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and mechanisms involved can probably be used in risk assessment.

2011-01-01,A comparative study of non-covalent encapsulation methods for organic dyes into silica nanoparticles,"Numerous luminophores may be encapsulated into silica nanoparticles (< 100 nm) using the reverse microemulsion process. Nevertheless, the behaviour and effect of such luminescent molecules appear to have been much less studied and may possibly prevent the encapsulation process from occurring. Such nanospheres represent attractive nanoplatforms for the development of biotargeted biocompatible luminescent tracers. Physical and chemical properties of the encapsulated molecules may be affected by the nanomatrix. This study examines the synthesis of different types of dispersed silica nanoparticles, the ability of the selected luminophores towards incorporation into the silica matrix of those nanoobjects as well as the photophysical properties of the produced dye-doped silica nanoparticles. The nanoparticles present mean diameters between 40 and 60 nm as shown by TEM analysis. Mainly, the photophysical characteristics of the dyes are retained upon their encapsulation into the silica matrix, leading to fluorescent silica nanoparticles. This feature article surveys recent research progress on the fabrication strategies of these dye-doped silica nanoparticles. © 2011 Auger et al."

2011-01-01,"NANODEVICE: Novel concepts, methods, and technologies for the production of portable, easy-to-use devices for the measurement and analysis of airborne engineered nanoparticles in workplace air","NANODEVICE is a research project funded by the European Commission in the context of the 7th Framework Programme. The duration is 48 months starting 1st of April 2009. Due to their unique properties, engineered nanoparticles (ENP) are now used for a myriad of novel applications, and have a great economic and technological importance. However, some of these properties, especially their surface reactivity, have raised health concerns due to their potential health effects. There is currently a shortage of field-worthy, cost-effective ways - especially in real time - for reliable assessment of exposure levels to ENP in workplace air. NANODEVICE will provide new information on the physico-chemical properties of engineered nanoparticles (ENP) and information about their toxicology. The main emphasis of the project is in the development of novel measuring devices to assess the exposure to ENP's from workplace air. The purpose of the project is also to promote the safe use of ENP through guidance, standards and education, implementing of safety objectives in ENP production and handling, and promotion of safety related collaborations through an international nanosafety forum. The main project goal is to develop innovative concepts and reliable methods for characterizing ENP in workplace air with novel, portable and easy-to-use devices suitable for workplaces."
2011-01-01,Direct quantification of airborne nanoparticles composition by TXRF after collection on filters,"Direct TXRF analysis of nanoparticles deposited on filters was evaluated. Standard filters spiked with known amounts of NP were produced using an atomizer which generates an aerosol from a NP containing-liquid suspension. Polycarbonate filters provided the highest fluorescence signals and black polycarbonate filters containing chromium were further selected, Cr being used as internal standard for elemental quantification of the filter contaminants. Calibration curves were established for various NP (TiO2, ZnO, CeO2, Al2O3). Good linearity was observed. Low limits of detection were in the tens to the hundreds of ngs per filter, the method being less adapted to Al2O3 due to the poor TXRF sensitivity for light elements. The analysis of MW-CNTs was attempted by quantification of their metal (Fe) catalyst impurities. Problems like CNT dispersion in liquids, quantification of the deposited quantity and high Fe-background contamination."
2011-01-01,Status of characterization techniques for carbon nanotubes and suggestions towards standards suitable for toxicological assessment,"Nanotechnologies promise to contribute significantly to major technological challenges of the upcoming century. Despite profound scientific progress in the last decades, only minor advances have been made in the field of nanomaterial toxicology. The International Team in Nanosafety (TITNT) is an international and multidisciplinary group of scientists, which aims at better understanding the risks of nanomaterials. Carbon nanotubes (CNT) account for one of the most promising nanomaterials and have therefore been chosen as representative material for nanoscaled particles. They are currently investigated by the different platforms of TITNT. As a starting point, the present report summarizes a literature-based study on the physico-chemical properties of CNT, as they are closely linked with toxicological properties. A brief introduction to synthesis, purification and material properties is given. Characterization methods for CNT are discussed with respect to their reliability and the information content on chemical properties. Recommendations for a set of standard characterizations mandatory for toxicological assessment are derived."
2011-01-01,Development of a novel method to detect a potential inhalation of nanoaerosols,"In the context of the precautionary principle for engineered nanoparticles, a test able to verify the non exposure of individuals to nanoaerosols seems to be of great interest, especially for workers involved with nanomaterials. A novel method is proposed to detect the presence of nanoparticles in the nose. Different materials, including paper and polycarbonate, have been tested for their sampling efficiency towards ZnO nanoparticles. The detection of nanoparticles is performed by elemental analysis using Total Reflection X-Ray Fluorescence (TXRF). For an optimal sensitivity of the TXRF signal, samples have to be deposited on a smooth surface. Therefore, different materials have been compared as sample carrier. The results indicate that pure paper is the most efficient material for sampling nanoparticles (ZnO), while the use of polycarbonate, and even more flexible polyester, as sample carrier allows a better sensitivity for TXRF analysis. Therefore, the sampling device made of paper is digested under slightly acidic conditions in a microwave oven after collection, and the resulting solution is deposited on polyester for TXRF analysis. Internal calibration is performed thanks to an addition of Rb to the samples. The proposed method allows the chemical identification of nanoparticles deposited in the nose: a qualitative signature of a potential nanoaerosol inhalation."
2011-01-01,The International Team in NanosafeTy (TITNT): A Multidisciplinary group for an improvement of Nanorisk Assessment and Management,"Nanotechnology allows the ability to design many new materials and devices with multiple applications, such as in medicine, electronics, and energy production. However, nanotechnology also raises several concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials. A report published by the Council of Canadian Academies points out the necessity to respond about many uncertainties associated with risk assessment for ensuring the safety of health and environment. Nanotoxicology (or Nanosafety) is a part of the toxicology science that aims to study adverse effects of nanomaterials or nanoparticles on living organisms. This field includes different aspects from workers prevention to the environment protection. Group of researchers have initiated an international powerful interactive milieu for researchers to work in concert for a global and integrated study of many aspects of nanotoxicology. The International Team in NanosafeTy (TITNT) is composed of research scientists from 5 different countries (Canada, USA, Japan, France and Germany) working together on 6 different specific thematics, and organized as 9 different technology platforms (www.titnt.com). TITNT aims to study different features of nanomaterials related to nanosafety, such as in vivo and in vitro studies, life cycle, occupational protections and monitoring, early biomarkers detection, characterization and nanotoxicokinetic/dynamic assessment during and after nanoparticles synthesis and the societal, public policy and environmental aspects. While the rapid growth of nanotechnology is opening up a floodgate of opportunities, the legislation related is lagging behind mainly because of a lack of knowledge in the biosafety of most nanomaterials. The main goal of TITNT is to improve knowledge in nanosafety science for the benefit of the discipline, for better public policies and for the public itself."
2011-01-01,Coordination and collaboration in European research towards healthy and safe nanomaterials,"Nanotechnology is becoming part of our daily life in a wide range of products such as computers, bicycles, sunscreens or nanomedicines. While these applications already become reality, considerable work awaits scientists, engineers, and policy makers, who want such nanotechnological products to yield a maximum of benefit at a minimum of social, environmental, economic and (occupational) health cost. Considerable efforts for coordination and collaboration in research are needed if one wants to reach these goals in a reasonable time frame and an affordable price tag. This is recognized in Europe by the European Commission which funds not only research projects but also supports the coordination of research efforts. One of these coordination efforts is NanoImpactNet, a researcher-operated network, which started in 2008 promote scientific cross-talk across all disciplines on the health and environmental impact of nanomaterials. Stakeholders contribute to these activities, notably the definition of research and knowledge needs. Initial discussions in this domain focused on finding an agreement on common metrics, and which elements are needed for standardized approaches for hazard and exposure identification. There are many nanomaterial properties that may play a role. Hence, to gain the time needed to study this complex matter full of uncertainties, researchers and stakeholders unanimously called for simple, easy and fast risk assessment tools that can support decision making in this rapidly moving and growing domain. Today, several projects are starting or already running that will develop such assessment tools. At the same time, other projects investigate in depth which factors and material properties can lead to unwanted toxicity or exposure, what mechanisms are involved and how such responses can be predicted and modelled. A vision for the future is that once these factors, properties and mechanisms are understood, they can and will be accounted for in the development of new products and production processes following the idea of ""Safety by Design"". The promise of all these efforts is a future with nanomaterials where most of their risks are recognized and addressed before they even reach the market."
2011-01-01,Nanoparticle risk management and cost evaluation: A general framework,"Industrial production of nano-objects has been growing fast during the last decade and a wide range of products containing nanoparticles (NPs) is proposed to the public in various markets (automotive, electronics, textiles). The issues encountered in monitoring the presence of nano-objects in any media cause a major difficulty for controlling the risk associated to the production stage. It is therefore very difficult to assess the efficiency of prevention and mitigation solutions, which potentially leads to overestimate the level of the protection barriers that are recommended. The extra costs in adding nano-objects to the process, especially that of nanosafety, must be estimated and optimized to ensure the competitiveness of the future production lines and associated products. The risk management and cost evaluation methods presented herein have been designed for application in a pilot production line of injection-moulded nanocomposites."

We aim to characterize typical exposures in our laboratories and to develop a health surveillance protocol for persons working with nanomaterials in this project that has recently been launched. Methods: Our surveillance project builds on existing occupational safety and health risk assessment systems in the National University of Singapore. Results: Environmental monitoring will be conducted in all laboratories handling nanomaterials, encompassing airborne nanomaterial concentrations, characterizing chemical and physical properties and assessing dermal exposure potential and significance.

2011-01-01,Towards nanotechnology regulation - Publish the unpublishable,"In an ideal world, regulation should seek to facilitate and harmonize the identification, characterization and control of all hazards, exposures and risks associated with substances and products, to protect human health and the environment, while at the same time enhancing industrial competitiveness and innovation. To date, this is the center of current global debates on nanotechnology and its products. A challenging situation now occurs. Nanotoxicology data are required, many studies are ongoing and yet the questions remain open as to whether the obtained data are appropriate and what existing data can be used here. A critical aspect, perhaps even the most critical aspect of nanotoxicology, is the availability of no-effect data.

2011-01-01,Carbon nanotubes and pleural damage: Perspectives of nanosafety in the light of asbestos experience,"Carbon nanotubes are molecular-scale one-dimensional manufactured materials which display several potential applications in engineering and materials science. Burgeoning evidence demonstrates that carbon nanotubes and asbestos share comparable physical properties. Therefore carbon nanotubes might display toxic effects and the extent of the toxicity is more specifi{ligature}cally directed to lung and pleura. These effects are related to properties of carbon nanotubes, such as their structure, length, aspects ratio, surface area, degree of aggregation, extent of oxidation, bound functional group, method of manufacturing, concentration and dose. At the present there is no global agreement about the risk of carbon nanotubes on human health and in particular on their transformation capacity. Safety concerns regarding carbon nanotubes can be ameliorated. In this context, it is important to put the known hazards of carbon nanotubes into perspective. Here is presented an overview about toxicity issues in the application of carbon nanotubes to biological systems, taking into consideration the already known asbestos-induced mechanisms of biological damages. © 2011 American Vacuum Society."
2011-01-01,Exposure control strategies in the carbonaceous nanomaterial industry,Objective: Little is known about exposure control strategies currently being implemented to minimize exposures during the production or use of nanomaterials in the United States. Our goal was to estimate types and quantities of materials used and factors related to workplace exposure reductions among companies manufacturing or using engineered carbonaceous nanomaterials (ECNs). Methods: Information was collected through phone surveys on work practices and exposure control strategies from 30 participating producers and users of ECN. The participants were classified into three groups for further examination. Results: We report here the use of exposure control strategies. Observed patterns suggest that large-scale manufacturers report greater use of nanospecific exposure control strategies particularly for respiratory protection. Conclusion: Workplaces producing or using ECN generally report using engineering and administrative controls as well as personal protective equipment to control workplace employee exposure.

2011-01-01,Fast evolving nanotechnology and relevant programs and entities in China,"In recent years, facing serious global competition, the Chinese government has focused on accelerating the growth of the advanced technology sector including nanotechnology in order to lift the country's status from manufacturing raw materials and goods up to innovation technology, information economy and green efficient energy. With trillions in tangible monetary reserves, the government has substantially increased its investment in nanotechnology through several major initiatives. These measures comprise tax incentives and low rents for new facilities within economic development parks to stimulate the growth of new nanotechnology-related companies and attract foreign investment. This article outlines some of the current nanotechnology businesses, programs and markets across China, including its technology focus, collaborations, geography, and funding from central and local governments and from the private sector. Efforts are being made in China to increase the number and quality of nanotechnology-related publications and patents, and to pursue industrial-scale production of nanomaterials with the intention of opening up opportunities for new businesses to sprout and grow. Watching China's shift to a nation that promotes innovation will be an exciting time for the global nanotechnology community.

A novel siRNA elimination pathway was identified. In this pathway, liver-enriched siRNA is secreted into the gallbladder and then emptied into the intestine. Blocking this pathway resulted in the absence of siRNA fluorescence within the intestine, with greatly enhanced siRNA accumulation in liver and gallbladder at the same time.

The chemical structures of copolymers were determined by FT-IR, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, 13C NMR, 31P NMR, thermogravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. Doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded copolymer nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by double emulsion and nanoprecipitation methods. The factors of copolymer composition and fabrication methods, which influence size and encapsulation efficiency (EE) were investigated. Their EE to DOX could reach 90.6% at an available condition. In vitro release behavior of NPs showed a continuous release after a burst release. The antitumor activity of the DOX-loaded NPs against cancer HepG2 and A549 cells was evaluated by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide method. The DOX-loaded copolymer NPs showed comparable anticancer efficacy with the free drug. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association."
2011-01-01,β-Amyloid peptide increases levels of iron content and oxidative stress in human cell and Caenorhabditis elegans models of Alzheimer disease,"Recent studies indicate that the deposition of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) is related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD); however, the underlying mechanism is still not clear. The abnormal interactions of Aβ with metal ions such as iron are implicated in the process of Aβ deposition and oxidative stress in AD brains. In this study, we observed that Aβ increased the levels of iron content and oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing the Swedish mutant form of human β-amyloid precursor protein (APPsw) and in Caenorhabditis elegans Aβ-expressing strain CL2006. Intracellular iron and calcium levels and reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide generation significantly increased in APPsw cells compared to control cells. The activity of superoxide dismutase and the antioxidant levels of APPsw cells were significantly lower than those of control cells. Moreover, iron treatment decreased cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential and aggravated oxidative stress damage as well as the release of Aβ1-40 from the APPsw cells. The iron homeostasis disruption in APPsw cells is very probably associated with elevated expression of the iron transporter divalent metal transporter 1, but not transferrin receptor. Furthermore, the C. elegans with Aβ-expression had increased iron accumulation. In aggregate, these results demonstrate that Aβ accumulation in neuronal cells correlated with neuronal iron homeostasis disruption and probably contributed to the pathogenesis of AD. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

2011-01-01,Amphiphilic and biodegradable methoxy polyethylene glycol-block-(polycaprolactone-graft-poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate)) as an effective gene carrier,"A group of amphiphilic cationic polymers, methoxy polyethylene glycol-block-(polycaprolactone-graft-poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate)) (PECD), were synthesized by combining ring-opening polymerization (ROP) and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) methods to form nanoparticles (NPs). The structures of these amphiphilic cationic polymers were characterized by 1H NMR measurement. The PECD NPs have hydrophobic cores covered with hydrophilic PEG and cationic PDMAEMA chains. These self-assembly nanoparticles were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique. PECD NPs can effectively condense DNA to form compact complexes of the size 65-160 nm suitable for gene delivery. The in vitro gene transfection studies of HeLa and HepG2 cells show that PECD NPs have better transfection efficiency compared to polyethylenimine (PEI) and Lipofectamine 2000 at low dose (N/P = 5). The cytotoxicity result shows that PECD NPs/DNA complexes at the optimal N/P ratio for transfection have comparable toxicity with PEI and Lipofectamine. These results indicate that PECD NPs have a great potential to be used as efficient polymeric carriers for gene transfection. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."
2011-01-01,Nanoparticle carriers based on copolymers of poly(ε-caprolactone) and hyperbranched polymers for drug delivery,"Novel amphiphilic copolymers based on poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and hyperbranched poly (amine-ester) (HPAE) with various compositions were synthesized. The amphiphilic copolymers can self-assemble into nanoscopic micelles and their hydrophobic cores can encapsulate doxorubicin (DOX) in aqueous solutions. The DOX-loaded HPAE-co-PCL nanoparticles diameter increased from 121 to 184. nm with the increasing PCL segment in the copolymer composition. An in vitro study at 37 °C demonstrated that DOX-release from nanoparticles at pH 5.0 was much faster than that at pH 7.4. The cytotoxicity for HeLa cells study demonstrated that DOX-loaded HPAE-co-PCL nanoparticles exhibited the anti-tumor effect was enhanced significantly, suggesting that the DOX-loaded HPAE-co-PCL nanoparticles have great potential as a tumor drug carrier. © 2010 Elsevier Inc."
2010-12-15,Pulmonary responses to printer toner particles in mice after intratracheal instillation,"The release of ultrafine particles from office equipment is currently receiving great concerns due to its potential threat to human health when inhaled. Printer toner is one of the largest consumables in daily office work, and the particles released from printers and photocopiers may pose damage to respiratory system. In this study, we found the particles can be released into the surrounding environment during the printing process and the concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 particles increased obviously. To evaluate the time-course pulmonary responses caused by toner particles, the toner suspension was instilled into the lungs of the male mice through intratracheally instillation every other day for four times and the pulmonary responses of the lung were monitored at days 9, 28, 56 and 84. Indeed, mice treated with toner particles displayed a slower body weight growth rate during the recovery phase. The total cell number in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) of toner-exposed groups was much higher than the saline-treated groups. The total protein, lactate dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase in BALF exhibited significant changes (p<0.05 or p<0.01) at different time points. The nitric oxide synthase, interleukin 1-beta, and interleukin 6 in the lung tissue of the toner-exposed groups also exhibited significant changes (p<0.05 or p<0.01). The pathological examination showed that toner particles can adhere to the alveolar septal walls, then enter into the alveoli and cause pulmonary lesion. During the experimental period, particles phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages (AMs) led to an increase of both AMs number and apoptosis. The pulmonary stress still remained over time even with a clearance period for 12 weeks. These results indicate that exposure to toner particles can inhibit the normal growth of the mice and induce significant inflammatory responses and lesion in the lung tissues. The health and safety effects from working indoors in offices with fumes and particles released from photocopiers and printers need to be paid more attention. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."
2010-12-14,Strategy for the modification of electrospun fibers that allows diverse functional groups for biomolecular entrapment,"A method to functionalize surfaces of electrospun (ES) fibers under relatively mild, aqueous conditions, that allows diverse functional groups for biomolecular entrapment, was reported. A well-developed biosilicification of certain marine organisms that catalyze silica acid polymerization under physiological conditions via proteins called silaffins is employed. To initiate homogeneous polymerization of silica acid on fibers, the initiator, 2-(dimethylamino) ethylmethacrylate (DMAEMA), was introduced, onto surfaces via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The results show that highly dense DMAEMA could be easily achieved to precipitate silica layer with thickness of 100 nm within 10 min. Precursors of organosilane are likely to strongly adsorb on the PDMAEMA via electrostatic interactions and polymerize to form networks to further concrete on them."
2010-12-10,Management of nanomaterials safety in research environment,"Despite numerous discussions, workshops, reviews and reports about responsible development of nanotechnology, information describing health and environmental risk of engineered nanoparticles or nanomaterials is severely lacking and thus insufficient for completing rigorous risk assessment on their use. However, since preliminary scientific evaluations indicate that there are reasonable suspicions that activities involving nanomaterials might have damaging effects on human health; the precautionary principle must be applied. Public and private institutions as well as industries have the duty to adopt preventive and protective measures proportionate to the risk intensity and the desired level of protection. In this work, we present a practical, 'user-friendly' procedure for a university-wide safety and health management of nanomaterials, developed as a multi-stakeholder effort (government, accident insurance, researchers and experts for occupational safety and health). The process starts using a schematic decision tree that allows classifying the nano laboratory into three hazard classes similar to a control banding approach (from Nano 3 - highest hazard to Nano1 - lowest hazard). Classifying laboratories into risk classes would require considering actual or potential exposure to the nanomaterial as well as statistical data on health effects of exposure. Due to the fact that these data (as well as exposure limits for each individual material) are not available, risk classes could not be determined. For each hazard level we then provide a list of required risk mitigation measures (technical, organizational and personal). The target 'users' of this safety and health methodology are researchers and safety officers. They can rapidly access the precautionary hazard class of their activities and the corresponding adequate safety and health measures. We succeed in convincing scientist dealing with nano-activities that adequate safety measures and management are promoting innovation and discoveries by ensuring them a safe environment even in the case of very novel products. The proposed measures are not considered as constraints but as a support to their research. This methodology is being implemented at the Ecole Polytechnique de Lausanne in over 100 research labs dealing with nanomaterials. It is our opinion that it would be useful to other research and academia institutions as well. © 2010 Groso et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

In the present study, sol-gel driven nickel ferrite (NiFe2O 4) and cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) nanoparticles (10-25 nm) at different concentrations were incorporated into biodegradable polymer, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), using oil-in-oil emulsion/solvent evaporation technique, and then the cytotoxicity of magnetic nanocomposite spheres was characterized using raw cells. The test provides the toxicity of the products prior to their real applications, which may limit animal experimentation, remove potential toxic compounds and reduce the downstream costs. The cytotoxicity results showed that both magnetic nanocomposite spheres were toxic at some degree to the raw cells; however, the cobalt ferrite nanoparticles in nanocomposite spheres are more toxic than the nickel ferrite nanoparticles.

2010-12-01,Effects of copper nanoparticles on the development of zebrafish embryos,"The environmental behavior and the potential toxicity of copper nanoparticles (nano-Cu) in water are major concerns for assessing their environmental safety. The present study was undertaken to characterize the properties of nano-Cu in E3 medium, such as size changes, solubility, zeta-potential and pH, and to test the toxicity of nano-Cu suspension to zebrafish embryos. Dynamic light scattering and solubility experiments showed that three components coexisted in the nano-Cu exposure system, including small nano-Cu aggregates still suspended in E3 medium, large nano-Cu aggregates deposited on the container bottom and dissolved copper species (Cu (dis)). Both the zeta-potential of nano-Cu particles in E3 medium and the pH of the nano-Cu suspension showed no change during a 24 hour period. It is found that nano-Cu retarded the hatching of zebrafish embryos and caused morphological malformation of the larvae, and high concentrations (>0.1 mg/L) of nano-Cu even killed the gastrula-stage zebrafish embryos. Cu 2+ ions were used to study the toxicity caused by nano-Cu dissolution. The embryo toxicity of nano-Cu at 0.01 and 0.05 mg/L showed no significant difference from Cu 2+ at the corresponding concentrations (0.006 and 0.03 mg/L), but 0.1 mg/L nano-Cu had a greater toxicity than 0.06 mg/L Cu 2+.

2010-12-01,Surface modification induced shielding effects on electron orbital coupling in metallofullerene,"The electronic properties of four metallofullerenol samples (La@C 82(OH) 32, La@C 82(OH) 24, La@C 82(OH) 18, La@C 82(OH) 12) and La@C 82 were investigated by synchrotron radiation photo-electron emission spectra (PES). A new emission peak with binding energy of 13.9 eV, which is attributed to La 5d orbitals coupling with nanocage orbitals, is observed in PES of La@C 82 for the first time. This suggestion is also supported by previous DFT calculations. Furthermore, the new emission peak disappears when the surface of La@C 82 is modified with specific numbers of OH groups, which means the electron orbital coupling between inner metallic atoms and outer nanocage in metallofullerene could be shielded by surface modifications on the outer nanocage.

2010-12-01,Subcellular distribution of polyhydroxylated metallofullerene Gd@C <inf>82</inf>(OH) <inf>22</inf> in different tissues of tumor-bearing mice,"Endohedral metallofullerenes have unique chemical and physical properties that are essential for biomedical applications. They can be used as a radiotracer in magnetic resonance and X-ray imaging (MRI and XRI). Polyhydroxylated metallofullerene Gd@C 82(OH) x has been studied as a new high efficient contrast agents for MRI and has also shown high efficiency for antitumor growth. Previous studies have shown that Gd@C 82(OH) 22 mainly accumulated in bone, pancreas, liver and kidney after intraperitoneal administration. However, whether the nanoparticles can enter into cells and the site of their potential action remains unclear. In this work, the distribution patterns of Gd@C 82(OH) 22 in subcellular compartments were studied using the techniques of differential centrifugation and ICP-MS analysis. The results indicate that the Gd@C 82(OH) 22 can enter into cells and the subcellular distribution patterns are significantly different from that of GdCl 3. GdCl 3 has much higher bioavailability for mice than Gd@C 82(OH) 22. Therefore, the present data suggest that Gd@C 82(OH) 22 in living systems may be not decomposed to release free Gd 3+ ion and may be metabolized as a pristine carbon cage.

2010-12-01,Ag nanoparticles coated SWCNT with surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signals,"We report here a simple method to fabricate the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) coated DNA-SWCNTs that give SERS signals. Dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) suggested the products are dispersive and soluble in aqueous solution. The Raman scattering spectra show AgNPs coated SWCNTs have enhanced the Raman signal when compared with pure SWCNT. From the radial breathing mode (RBM) of the Raman spectra, we can disclose that this DNA-SWCNT has unique chirality, which implies that it could be a good nanoprobe for cell marking.

2010-12-01,Cytotoxicity of zinc oxide nanoparticles: Importance of microenvironment,"While ZnO particles are widely used in many fields, including personal care products, the high toxicity of ZnO nanoparticles has been reported and aroused great health concerns. In this study, the cytotoxicity of ZnO nanoparticles was evaluated and, in particular, the role of microenvironment in their toxicity was investigated. Our results show that ZnO nanoparticles are highly toxic to NIH/3T3 cells, inducing viability loss, membrane leakage and morphology changes. The microenviroment, here the C0 2 atmosphere under cell culture condition, promoted the solubilization of ZnO nanoparticles. Then the released Zn from ZnO nanoparticles induces the cytotoxicity. The importance of microenvironment on the ZnO nanotoxicity is presented and the implications to future nanotoxicology studies are discussed. Copyright © 2010 American Scientific Publishers."
2010-12-01,Modulation of oxidative stress by functionalized fullerene materials in the lung tissues of female C57/BL mice with a metastatic Lewis lung carcinoma,"Oxidative stress is considered to be one of the important mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis. To investigate the effect of [Gd@C 82(OH) 22] n and [C 60(OH) 20] n nanoparticles on the oxidative stress in the tumor-bearing mice, several antioxidative enzymes and antioxidants were tested for mice with or without tumor inoculation. Transplanted tumors were grown in mice by subcutaneous inoculation of a metastatic Lewis lung carcinoma in female C57/BL mice. More importantly, the tumor cells can metastasize into the normal lung tissues gradually. Therefore, in present paper, the activities of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione S-transferase (GST), as well as the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the tumor-invaded lung tissues of the tumor-bearing mice were compared to the nomal lung tissues of normal mice. After treatment with nanoparticles, the activities of GSH-Px and GST and other parameters related to the oxidative stress were downregulated and tended closely to the normal levels. Pulmonary histopathological results also showed that two different types of water-soluble fullerenes can prevent lungs from inflammatory lesion and tumor invasion. These findings indicate two different types of water-soluble fullerenes materials can downregulate the oxidative stress status by scavenging excessive free radicals and inhibiting the lipid peroxidation in tumor-bearing mice, which can partly explain their protective roles on the pulmonary oxidative-damage induced by the tumor metastasis to lung tissues.

2010-12-01,Biomedical activities of endohedral metallofullerene optimized for nanopharmaceutics,"Endohedral metallofullerenes, a novel form of carbon-related nanomaterials, currently attract wide attention for their potential applications in biomedical fields such as therapeutic medicine. Most endohedral metallofullerenes are synthesized using C 60 or higher molecular weight fullerenes because of the limited interior volume of fullerene. It is known that the encapsulated metal atom has strong electronic interactions with the carbon cage in metallofullerenes. Gd@C 82 is one of the most important molecules in the metallofullerene family, known as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast agent candidate for diagnostic imaging. Gadolinium endohedral metallofullerenol (e.g., Gd@C 82(OH) 22) is a functionalized fullerene with gadolinium trapped inside carbon cage. Our group previously demonstrated that the distinctive chemical and physical properties of Gd@C 82(OH) 22 are dependent on the number and position of the hydroxyl groups on the fullerene cage. The present article summarizes our latest findings of biomedical effects of Gd@C 82(OH) 22 and gives rise to a connected flow of the existing knowledge and information from experts in the field. It briefly narrates the synthesis and physico-chemical properties of Gd@C 82(OH) 22. The polyhydroxylated nanoparticles exhibit the enhanced water solubility and high purity, and were tested as a MRI contrast agent. Gd@C 82(OH) 22 treatment inhibited tumor growth in tumor-bearing nude mice. Although the precise mechanisms of this action are not well defined, our in vitro data suggest involvements of improved immunity and antioxidation by Gd@C 82(OH) 22 and its size-based selective targeting to tumor site. The review critically analyzed the relevant data instead of fact-listing, and explained the potential for developing Gd@C 82(OH) 22 into a diagnostic or therapeutic agent.

2010-12-01,In vitro cytotoxicity of transparent yellow iron oxide nanoparticles on human glioma cells,"With rapid development of nanotechnology, concerns about the possible adverse health effects on human beings by using nanomaterials have been raised. Transparent yellow iron oxide (α-FeOOH) nanoparticles have been widely used in paints, plastic, rubber, building materials, papermaking, food products and pharmaceutical industry, thus the potential health implications by the exposure should be considered. The purpose of this study is to assess the cytotoxicity of transparent yellow iron oxide nanoparticles on U251 human glioma cells. The α-FeOOH nanoparticles are in clubbed shapes with 9 nm in diameter and 43 nm long. The specific surface area is 115.3 m 2/g. After physicochemical characterization of the nanoparticles, U251 cells were exposed to α-FeOOH at the doses of 0, 3.75, 15, 60 and 120 (μg/mL. The results showed that the α-FeOOH nanoparticles reduced the cell viability and induced necrosis and apoptosis in U251 cells. In addition, nanoparticle exposure significantly increased the levels of superoxide anion and nitric oxide in a dose-dependent fashion in the cells. Our results suggest that exposure to α-FeOOH nanoparticles induce significant free radical formation and cytotoxic effects. The large surface area that induced high surface reactivity may play an important role in the cytotoxic effect of α-FeOOH nanoparticles. Copyright © 2010 American Scientific Publishers."
2010-12-01,Oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by iron oxide nanoparticles in cultured human umbilical endothelial cells,"Recent epidemiologic researches indicate that exposure to ultrafine particles (nanoparticles) is an independent risk factor for several cardiovascular diseases. The induction of endothelial injuries is hypothesized to be an attractive mechanism involved in these cardiovascular diseases. To investigate this hypothesis, the widely used iron nanomaterials, ferric oxide (Fe 2O 3) and ferriferrous oxide (Fe 3O 4) nanoparticles were incubated with human umbilical endothelial cells (ECV304 cells) at different concentrations of 2, 20, 100 μg/mL. The cell viability, the rate of apoptosis, the apoptotic nuclear morphology and the mitochondria membrane potential were measured to estimate the cell necrosis and apoptosis caused by the nanoparticle exposure. The stimulation of superoxide anion (O 2·-) and nitric oxide (NO) were examined to evaluate the stress responses of endothelial cells. Our results indicated that both the Fe 2O 3 and Fe 3O 4 nanoparticles could generate oxidative stress as well as the significant increase of nitric oxide in ECV304 cells. The loss of mitochondria membrane potential and the apoptotic chromatin condensation in the nucleus were observed as the early signs of apoptosis. It is inferred the stress response might be an important mechanism involving in endothelial cells apoptosis and death, and these injuries in endothelial cells might play a key role in downstream cardiovascular diseases such as atheroscelerosis, hypertension and myocardial infarction (MI).

2010-12-01,Transmembrane delivery of aggregated [Gd@C <inf>82</inf>(OH) <inf>22</inf>] <inf>n</inf> nanoparticles,"We investigated whether multi-hydroxyl metallofullerenes can penetrate into erythrocyte and whether this potential transmembrane delivery requires aggregated nanostructure of these particles. The metal atom encapsulated in metallofullerenes was used as a quantitative marker to investigate body distribution of aggregated nanoparticles in cytomembrane and cytoplasm. Image of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and assay of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) suggested that aggregated [Gd@C 82(OH) 22] n particles traversed through cytomembrane into cytoplasm. Aggregated Gd nanostructure belonged to small sphere with average diameter of 22.4 ±0.5 nm. For pristine Gd@C 82 molecule, due to the electron donation from Gd atom, the distribution of electrons on the surface of carbon cage was localized. The electrophilic additive reaction of polyhydroxyl on the surface of Gd@C 82 was directly affected by local distribution of electrons. This resulted in local distribution of hydroxyls on the surface of Gd nanoparticles. Local distribution of hydroxyls brought about polar and nonpolar domains on particle surface, which induced Gd@C 82(OH) 22 to be amphiphilic molecule with due hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. Amphiphilic properties of these molecules promoted their mutual aggregation in water. In the process of aggregation, amphiphilic properties of aggregated nanoparticles were well maintained, and besides, hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains were also regularly distributed on the surface of [Gd@C 82(OH) 22] n particles. The amphiphilic nanoparticles attached externally to cytomembrane of erythrocyte might be effectively driven by hydrophobic effect when they directly contacted cytomembrane of erythrocyte. The number of [Gd@C 82(OH) 22] n nanoparticles attached to cytomembrane reached up to a certain critical threshold, a significant curvature tension of membrane would occur. The shape of cell was accordingly changed. Increased membrane tension triggered the sudden opening of specific pores as a result of cytmembrane response to nanoparitcle effect and the [Gd@C 82(OH) 22] n nanoparticles gained entry to cell via these pores. This process was biologically independent of caveolar-mediated endocytosis or transportation pathway via ion channels. Copyright © 2010 American Scientific Publishers."

We investigate these particles from the viewpoint of nanosafety (penetration into skin in vivo, production of free radicals when UV-irradiated) as well as UV protection. We show that: a) even after multiple applications, the particles remain within stratum corneum (uppermost skin layer); b) the optimal sizes are 62 nm and 45 nm, respectively for TiO2 and ZnO particles for 310-nm light and, correspondingly, 122 and 140 nm - for 400-nm radiation; c) in general, small particles (25 nm in diameter) are more photoactive than the larger ones (400 nm in diameter); however, on the background if porcine skin in vitro this difference is not seen and is substantially surpassed by skin contribution into production of free radicals. © 2010 SPIE."

The mechanism is the abstraction of thiols by Hg2+ that led to the aggregation of nanoparticles. With the assistance of solar light irradiation, the detection limit can be as low as 30 nM, which satisfies the guideline concentration of Hg2+ in drinking water set by the WHO. In addition, the dynamic range of detection is wide (3 × 10-8 -1 × 10-2 M).

2010-11-09,Nanomaterials Optimized to improve delivery efficiency for gene therapy,"Polycationic nanoparticles are potential as polycationic nonviral vectors (polyplexes) to overcome the defects of traditional viral vectors. The low transfection efficiency in vivo was attributed to poor circulation of polyplexes with high residual positive charges on the surface, which cause them susceptible to agglomerate with negatively charged serum components and to be scavenged by macrophages, whereas, the positive charges are likewise beneficial polyplexes to interact with negative-charged plasma membranes of targeted cells and specifically increase intracellular transfection efficiency of polyplexes. Numerous studies focused on revealing the relationship between the structure of polycationic vectors and the transfection efficiency in vivo. The designed polyplexes in our group to extend nanoparticles circulation is possible to overcome other barriers including endosome escape, cytoplasmic transport and nuclear entry for ultimately successful gene transfection in vivo. Polyplexes circulation was prolonged by modifying with polycations such as PEIs, PDMAEMA, chitosan et al. It was found that PEGylation of polyplexes could improve the stability of polyplexes in vivo but dramatically decrease therapeutic efficiency due to reduced transfection. In addition, the strong hydrophilicity of the PEG segments could dissociate PEGylated polyplexes under the physiological environment and attenuate polycation carrying with target genes. polycationic nonviral gene delivery vectors in order to improve the circulation time and transfection efficiency in vivo for efficient gene therapyin order to improve the circulation time. Polyplexes might be potential to be alternative nonviral gene delivery vectors for efficient clinical therapy."

Undesired bubble accumulation in microfluidic channels abruptly changes the microenvironment of adherent cells and leads to the damage and death of cells. Existing bubble trapping approaches have drawbacks such as the need to pause fluid flow, requirement for external vacuum or pressure source, and possible cytotoxicity. This study reports two kinds of integrated bubble trap (IBT) which have excellent properties, including simplicity in structure, ease in fabrication, no interference with the flow, and long-term stability. IBT-A provides the simplest solution to prevent bubbles from entering microfluidic channels. In situ time-lapse imaging experiments indicate that IBT-B is an excellent device both for bubble trapping and debubbling in cell-loaded microfluidics. MC 3T3 E1 cells, cultured in a long and curved microfluidic channel equipped with IBT-B, showed high viability and active proliferation after 10 days of continuous fluid flow. The comprehensive measures taken in our experiments have led to successful long-term, bubble-free, on-chip culture of cells. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010."
2010-11-01,Quaternized chitosan (QCS) nanoparticles as a novel delivery system for ammonium glycyrrhizinate,"The aim of this study was to generate a new type of nanoparticles made of quaternized chitosan (QCS) and poly(aspartic acid) via the ionotropic gelation technique and to evaluate their potential for the association and delivery of ammonium glycyrrhizinate (GLA). The effects of the pH value of nanoparticles, QCS molecular weight (Mw) and poly(aspartic acid) concentration on GLA encapsulation were studied. Suitably pH value of nanoparticles, moderate QCS MW, optimal concentration ratio of poly(aspartic acid) and QCS favored higher GLA encapsulation efficiency. The release of GLA from nanoparticles was pH-dependent. Fast release occurred in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH = 7.4), while the release was slow in 0.1 M HCI (pH = 1.2). The results showed that the new QCS/poly(aspartic acid) nanoparticles have a promising potential in GLA delivery system. Copyright © 2010 American Scientific Publishers."

In vivo, the probe significantly enhanced the MRI signal. The image contrast between the peripheral region of the tumor and the non-involved muscle was nearly 50% higher two hours after administration of the nanocomplex. The liposomal nanocomplex increased the amount of Gd accumulated in tumors by factor 2.8 compared to that accumulated by using Magnevist alone. Moreover, the heterogeneous MRI image features correlate well with the tumor pathology. The image enhancement patterns can be used for cancer prognosis and non-invasive monitoring of the response to therapy. Copyright © 2010 American Scientific Publishers."

For each specimen, two absorption images were scanned separately with energies E1 and E2: E1 was focused on the absorption edge of the chosen element and E2 was focused below the edge. A K-edge division method is proposed and applied to obtain the element mapping. Compared with the frequently used K-edge subtraction method, this ratio-contrast method is shown to be more accurate and sensitive in identifying the elements of interest, where the definition of the contrast threshold is simple and clear in physics.

2010-10-26,Control performance and biomembrane disturbance of carbon nanotube artificial water channels by nitrogen-doping,"To establish ways to control the performance of artificial water channels is a big challenge. With molecular dynamics studies, we found that water flow inside the water channels of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be controlled by reducing or intensifying interaction energy between water molecules and the wall of the CNTs channel. A way of example toward this significant goal was demonstrated by the doping of nitrogen into the wall of CNTs. Different ratios of nitrogen doping result in different controllable water performance which is dominated mainly through a gradient of van der Waals forces created by the heteroatom doping in the wall of CNTs. Further results revealed that the nitrogen-doped CNT channels show less influence on the integrality of biomembrane than the pristine one, while the nitrogen-doped double-walled carbon nanotube exhibits fewer disturbances to the cellular membrane integrality than the nitrogen-doped single-walled carbon nanotube when interacting with biomembranes. © 2010 American Chemical Society."

2010-10-01,Lysosomal proteolysis is the primary degradation pathway for cytosolic ferritin and cytosolic ferritin degradation is necessary for iron exit,"Cytosolic ferritins sequester and store iron, consequently protecting cells against iron-mediated free radical damage. However, the mechanisms of iron exit from the ferritin cage and reutilization are largely unknown. In a previous study, we found that mitochondrial ferritin (MtFt) expression led to a decrease in cytosolic ferritin. Here we showed that treatment with inhibitors of lysosomal proteases largely blocked cytosolic ferritin loss in both MtFt-expressing and wild-type cells. Moreover, cytosolic ferritin in cells treated with inhibitors of lysosomal proteases was found to store more iron than did cytosolic ferritins in untreated cells. The prevention of cytosolic ferritin degradation in MtFt-expressing cells significantly blocked iron mobilization from the protein cage induced by MtFt expression. These studies also showed that blockage of cytosolic ferritin loss by leupeptin resulted in decreased cytosolic ferritin synthesis and prolonged cytosolic ferritin stability, potentially resulting in diminished iron availability. Lastly, we found that proteasomes were responsible for cytosolic ferritin degradation in cells pretreated with ferric ammonium citrate. Thus, the current studies suggest that cytosolic ferritin degradation precedes the release of iron in MtFt-expressing cells; that MtFt-induced cytosolic ferritin decrease is partially preventable by lysosomal protease inhibitors; and that both lysosomal and proteasomal pathways may be involved in cytosolic ferritin degradation. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."
2010-10-01,Surface chemistry and aspect ratio mediated cellular uptake of Au nanorods,"Gold nanorods (Au NRs) have been recognized as promising materials for biomedical applications, like sensing, imaging, gene and drug delivery and therapy, but their toxicological issues are still controversial, especially for the Au NRs synthesized with seed-mediated method. In this study, we investigated the influence of aspect ratio and surface coating on their toxicity and cellular uptake. The cellular uptake is highly dependent on the aspect ratio and surface coating. However, the surface chemistry has the dominant roles since PDDAC-coated Au NRs exhibit a much greater ability to be internalized by the cells. The present data demonstrated shape-independent but coating-dependent cytotoxicity. Both the CTAB molecules left in the suspended solution and on the surface of Au NRs were identified as the actual cause of cytotoxicity. CTAB can enter cells with or without Au NRs, damage mitochondria, and then induce apoptosis. The effects of surface coating upon toxicity and cellular uptake were also examined using Au NRs with different coatings. When Au NRs were added into the medium, the proteins were quickly adsorbed onto the Au NRs that made the surface negatively charged. The surface charge may not directly affect the cellular uptake. We further demonstrated that the amount of serum proteins, especially for BSA, adsorbed on the Au NRs had a positive correlation with the capacity of Au NRs to enter cells. In addition, we have successfully revealed that the cationic PDDAC-coated Au NRs with an aspect ratio of 4 possess an ideal combination of both negligible toxicity and high cellular uptake efficiency, showing a great promise as photothermal therapeutic agents. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."
2010-10-01,Amphiphilic hyper-branched co-polymer nanoparticles for the controlled delivery of anti-tumor agents,"In this investigation, we have designed and synthesized an amphiphilic co-polymer with hyper-branched poly(amine-ester) and polylactide (HPAE-co-PLA) to generate nanoparticles (NPs). These have been used to encapsulate a highly active hydrophobic anti-tumor agent, 2-benzoylpyridine 4-ethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Bp4eT). Encapsulation in NPs was done in an effort to increase the anti-tumor activity of this agent by facilitating its delivery to tumor cells. We have also examined and optimized the formulation parameters of the NPs that alter their drug-loading capacity and their physical, chemical and biological properties. The resulting NPs exhibited high Bp4eT-loading capacity and substantial stability in aqueous solution. In vitro drug release studies demonstrated a controlled drug release profile with increased release at acidic pH. Anti-tumor proliferation assays showed that both free drug and drug-encapsulated NPs markedly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Direct microscopic observation revealed that the fluorescent NPs were taken up by cells and localized, in part, in organelles consistent with lysosomes. These results demonstrate a feasible application of the amphiphilic hyper-branched co-polymer, HPAE-co-PLA, as nanocarriers for intracellular delivery of potent anti-tumor agents. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis measurements of siRNA confirmed the occurrence of the charge-reversal property of functional gold nanoparticles. The expression efficiency of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was improved by adjuvant transfection with charge-reversal functional gold nanoparticles, which also had much lower toxicity to cell proliferation. Lamin A/C, an important nuclear envelope protein, was effectively silenced by lamin A/C-siRNA delivered by charge-reversal functional gold nanoparticles, whose knockdown efficiency was better than that of commercial Lipofectamine 2000. Confocal laser scanning microscopic images indicated that there was more cy5-siRNA distributed throughout the cytoplasm for cyanine 5-siRNA/polyethyleneimine/cis-aconitic anhydride-functionalized poly(allylamine)/ polyethyleneimine/11- mercaptoundecanoic acid-gold nanoparticle (cy5-siRNA/PEI/PAH-Cit/PEI/MUA-AuNP) complexes.

2010-09-15,Neuroprotective mechanism of mitochondrial ferritin on 6-hydroxydopamine- induced dopaminergic cell damage: Implication for neuroprotection in parkinson's disease,"Neuronal iron homeostasis disruption and oxidative stress are closely related to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Adult iron-regulatory protein 2 knockout (Ireb2-/-) mice develop iron accumulation in white matter tracts and nuclei in different brain area and display severe neurodegeneration in Purkinje cells of the cerebrum. Mitochondrial ferritin (MtFt), a newly discovered ferritin, specifically expresses in high energy-consuming cells, including neurons of brain and spinal cord. Interestingly, the decreased expression of MtFt in cerebrum, but not in striatum, matches the differential neurodegeneration pattern in these Ireb2 -/- mice. To explore its effect on neurodegeneration, the effects of MtFt expression on 6-hydrodopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neuronal damage was examined. The overexpression of MtFt led to a cytosolic iron deficiency in the neuronal cells and significantly prevented the alteration of iron redistribution induced by 6-OHDA. Importantly, MtFt strongly inhibited mitochondrial damage, decreased production of the reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation, and dramatically rescued apoptosis by regulating Bcl-2, Bax and caspase-3 pathways. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that MtFt plays an important role in preventing neuronal damage in an 6-OHDA-induced parkinsonian phenotype by maintaining iron homeostasis. Regulation of MtFt expression in neuronal cells may provide a new neuroprotective strategy for PD. Antioxid. © 2010 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

These pyrimidine-capped gold NPs exert their antibiotic actions via sequestration of magnesium or calcium ions to disrupt the bacterial cell membrane, resulting in leakage of cytoplasmic contents including nucleic acids from compromised cell membranes, and via interaction with DNA and inhibition of protein synthesis by internalized NPs. These amino-substituted pyrimidine-capped gold NPs induce bacterial resistance more slowly compared with conventional, small-molecule antibiotics and appear harmless to human cells; these NPs may hence be useful for clinical applications. © 2010 American Chemical Society."
2010-09-07,"Poly(ε-caprolactone)-graft-poly(2-(N, N-dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) nanoparticles: PH dependent thermo-sensitive multifunctional carriers for gene and drug delivery","pH-dependent temperature- sensitive poly(ε-caprolactone)-graft-poly(2- (dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) (PCL-g-PDMAEMA), a kind of degradable, amphiphilic, cationic copolymer, was synthesized. PCL-g-PDMAEMA was self-assembled into core-shell nanoparticles with an ultralow critical association concentration at about 8.1 × 10-4 g L-1. It was found that PCL-g-PDMAEMA nanoparticles were able to simultaneously entrap hydrophobic paclitaxel and load DNA. Hydrophobic drug paclitaxel, loaded by PCL-g-PDMAEMA NPs, could be released faster in an acidic environment than in a neutral environment, and PCL-g-PDMAEMA NPs showed a comparable in vitro gene transfection efficiency to Lipofectamine 2000. In addition, the gene transfection efficiency was enhanced by the addition of 5% serum. Besides, confocal microscopic measurements indicated that PCL-g-PDMAEMA nanoparticles/DNA polyplexes could escape from the endosome and release the payloads effectively in cytoplasm. These results suggest PCL-g-PDMAEMA has great potential for achieving the synergistic effect of drug and gene therapies in vivo. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry."
2010-09-01,State and local regulation of nanotechnology: Two opposing methodologies,"The nascent efforts of U.S. municipalities and states entering the nanotechnology regulation arena appear to be funneling them into one of two broad categories: Cities and states which are folding nanomaterials into their existing hazardous materials regulations, and cities and states which are forming task groups and committees to study the issues and provide feedback to the state. The first group is coalescing around the state's interest and responsibility in safeguarding the health of the public, its workers, and the environment. The second group generally has as one of its goals pursuing the potential economic and quality of life benefits that those states acknowledge may come from thoughtful application of nanotechnologies. This article offers a survey of the regulatory efforts pursued to date by cities-notably Berkeley, California and Cambridge, Massachusetts-and the several states which are venturing into the fray, and concludes that the second, more holistic approach to local and state-level regulation may yield the widest benefit to the citizen, the governing body, and the nanotechnology practitioner."

2010-09-01,New methods for nanotoxicology: Synchrotron radiation-based techniques,"Nanotoxicology, a new branch of bionanoscience, deals with the study and application of the toxic or biological effects of nanomaterials or nanostructures, and aims to fill gaps in our knowledge of interactions between nano- and biosystems. However, progress in this new discipline largely relies on developing methodology to characterize nanomaterials in biological samples, quantify nanoparticles in living systems, and study their uptake, translocation, biodistribution, location and chemical status in vitro and in vivo, etc. In this review article, we focus on the main features of synchrotron radiation-based methods and their application to the study of the toxicological activities of nanomaterials. Synchrotron radiation-based analytical techniques are shown to provide a potent means for characterizing the toxic or biological behaviors of nanoparticles in biological systems. © 2010 Springer-Verlag."
2010-09-01,Molecular interaction between europium decatungstate and histone H1 and its application as a novel biological labeling agent,"Polyoxometalates (POMs) show promising biological activities, but the mechanism of potential therapeutic effects remains to be elucidated at a molecular level. As a step toward the elucidation of the mechanistic pathways governing the bioactivity of POMs, the interaction between Eu-containing decatungstate [EuW10O36]9- (EuW10) and histone H1 has been studied. Fluorescence/luminescence analysis showed the existence of a strong interaction between EuW10 and histone H1. This interaction has key effects both on the luminescence of EuW10 and on the structure of histone H1. A gradual and intense enhancement of EuW10 luminescence was observed upon addition of increasing concentrations of histone H1. Circular dichroism investigations indicated that the binding of EuW10 significantly alters the secondary structure of histone H1. The present work is meaningful in finding novel labeling agents for fluorescence/luminescence or solid-state bioimaging. © 2010 SBIC."
2010-09-01,Development of neurons on micropatterns reveals that growth cone responds to a sharp change of concentration of laminin,"In this report we fabricated laminin (LN) stripes on a background of poly-L-lysine as substrates for the growth of rat hippocampal neurons, and found that a sharp change of the concentration of LN guides the growth of neurites by leading the growth cones in a time- and space-dependent manner. The percentage of neurites that grow along the edge of LN stripes (where there is a sharp change of concentration) decreases as a function of the concentration of LN under a threshold value. The actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in the process of growth cone's response to the sharp change of concentration of LN on micropatterns. We believe that the findings here are useful for not only fundamental studies in neuroscience, but also helpful for the design of devices or chips for nervous prosthesis. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2010-09-01,AIDS treatment with novel anti-HIV compounds improved by nanotechnology,"The first International Symposium of Nanomedicine on AIDS ""AIDS Treatment with Novel Anti-HIV compounds Improved by Nanotechnology"" was held November 19-20, 2009 in Beijing, China. This symposium provided an international forum for presentation and discussion of exciting new advances in the emerging research area of nanobiomedical research on AIDS treatment as the focus point, as well as some issues in relevant fields such as nanobiomedical research on tumor treatment and safety evaluation of nanomedicines. Key highlights of the symposium include (1) reviewing current status of nanobiotechnology programs and their relations, more or less, with AIDS treatment; (2) reviewing current AIDS epidemiology in China and examining effectiveness and efficiency of current prevention and treatment strategies; (3) highlighting the obstacles to improve AIDS prevention and treatment, and (4) exploring innovative ways for nanotechnology to advance AIDS treatment, especially to combat HIV resistance to drugs. © 2010 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists."
2010-08-01,Both Nramp1 and DMT1 are necessary for efficient macrophage iron recycling,"Objective: Divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (Nramp1) are iron transporters that localize, respectively, to the early and late endosomal compartments. DMT1 is ubiquitously expressed, while Nramp1 is found only within macrophages and neutrophils. Our previous studies have identified a role for Nramp1 during macrophage erythrophagocytosis; however, little is known about the function of DMT1 during this process. Materials and Methods: Wild-type RAW264.7 macrophages (RAW), and those stably transfected with Nramp1 (RAW/Nramp1) were treated with either DMT1-small interfering RNA, or with ebselen, a selective inhibitor of DMT1. Results: Although macrophages lacking either functional DMT1 or Nramp1 experienced a moderate reduction in iron recycling efficiency, the ability of macrophages lacking both functional DMT1 and Nramp1 to recycle hemoglobin-derived iron was severely compromised. Compared to macrophages singly deficient in either DMT1 or Nramp1 transport ability, macrophages where DMT1 and Nramp1 were both compromised exhibited an abrogated increase in labile iron pool content, released less iron, and experienced diminished upregulation of ferroportin and heme-oxygenase 1 levels following erythrophagocytosis. Conclusions: These results suggest that although the loss of either Nramp1 or DMT1 transport ability results in minor impairment after erythrophagocytosis, the simultaneous loss of both Nramp1 and DMT1 iron transport activity is detrimental to the iron recycling capacity of the macrophage. © 2010 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells."
2010-07-06,Lung deposition and extrapulmonary translocation of nano-ceria after intratracheal instillation,"The broad potential applications of manufactured nanomaterials call for urgent assessment of their environmental and biological safety. However, most of the previous work focused on the cell level performance; little was known about the consequences of nanomaterial exposure at the whole-body and organ levels. In the present paper, the radiotracer technique was employed to study the pulmonary deposition and the translocation to secondary target organs after ceria nanoparticles (nano-ceria) were intratracheally instilled into Wistar rats. It was found that 63.9 8.2% of the instilled nano-ceria remained in the lung by 28d postexposure and the elimination half-life was 103d. At the end of the test period, only 1/8-1/3 of the daily elimination of nano-ceria from the lung was cleared via the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages(AMs) with subsequent removal towards the larynx was no longer the predominant route for the elimination of nano-ceria from the lung. The whole-body redistribution of nano-ceria demonstrated that the deposited nano-ceria could penetrate through the alveolar wall into the systemic circulation and accumulate in the extrapulmonary organs. In vitro study suggested that nano-ceria would agglomerate and form sediments in the bronchoalveolar aqueous surrounding while binding to protein would be conducive to the redispersion of nano-ceria. The decrease in the size of agglomerates might enhance the penetration of nano-ceria into the systemic circulation. Our findings suggested that the effect of nanomaterial exposure, even at low concentration, should be assessed because of the potential lung and systemic cumulative toxicity of the nanomaterials. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd."
2010-07-01,Specific hemosiderin deposition in spleen induced by a low dose of cisplatin: Altered iron metabolism and its implication as an acute hemosiderin formation model,"Cisplatin is one of the commonly-used chemotherapeutic drugs to efficiently treat malignant tumors in clinic, however, the adverse effects of cisplatin such as nephrotoxicity, neurotoxcity, and hemolytic uremic syndrome are often observed at its clinical doses (∼60 mg/m2), which limit its broader application. In earlier studies, little attention was paid to the subtle changes in the architecture of lymphatic organs after low doses of cisplatin treatment. This paper reviews current understanding of cisplatin-induced erythrocyte injury, and presents our latest finding that a low dose of cisplatin (3.6 mg/m2/day, 14 days) could induce specific hemosiderin deposition in spleen of both normal and hepatoma-22 (H22) inoculated Balb/C mice. This dose of cisplatin significantly inhibited H22-induced acute ascites development. No significant toxicity was induced by this dose of cisplatin to tissues except for hemosiderin accumulation in the spleen of both normal and H22 tumor-bearing mice. Increased splenic iron content and erythrocyte injury were observed after treatment with the low dose of cisplatin. The mRNA levels of ferroportin (FPN1) and ferritin were upregulated by 25 and 5-fold in spleen, respectively. Overexpression of FPN1 and ferritin protein were also been observed at protein levels by Western blotting analysis. In addition, the mRNA expression of hepcidin was also increased, suggesting blockage of iron recycling through FPN1 in spleen with cisplatin treatment. In conclusion, cisplatin treatment damages the erythrocytes which accumulate in the red pulp of spleen with defective recycling of FPN1 and ferritin protein. Hepcidin inhibits the function of FPN1 as iron-exporter leading to iron overloaded inside ferritins of splenic cells, which are stained with abnormal hemosiderin accumulation. These results demonstrate that cisplatin-caused hemosiderin deposition in spleen provides a valuable clue for understanding the molecular basis of toxicity of cisplatin and hemosiderin accumulation and iron metabolism in vivo. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd."
2010-07-01,Studies on anti-tumor and antimetastatic activities of fullerenol in a mouse breast cancer model,"The purpose was to examine the anti-tumor and antimetastatic activities of fullerenol and their related mechanisms. Thirty EMT-6 tumor-bearing mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.1 ml saline or 0.1 ml saline containing fullerenol C60(OH)20 (0.08 and 0.4 mg/ml) daily for 16 days. Using tumor tissues, we investigated imbalances in the oxidative defense system and the expression of several angiogenesis factors. C60(OH)20 exhibits anti-tumor and antimetastatic activities in EMT-6 breast cancer metastasis model. Treatment with C60(OH)20 was found to modulate oxidative stress significantly. The expression of several angiogenesis factors was reduced in tumor tissues after treatment with fullerenol. Importantly, CD31 (also known as PECAM-1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule) expression and vessel density were markedly reduced in tumors from fullerenol-treated mice compared with controls. Modulation of oxidative stress in tumor tissues, inhibition of the formation of angiogenesis factors, and subsequent reduction in tumor vessel density and the nutrient supply to tumor cells could be important mechanisms by which fullerenol aggregates inhibit tumor growth and suppress carcinoma metastasis in vivo. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

2010-06-18,Interchain coupling induced localization/delocalization in coupled one-dimensional ordered and disordered chains,"A different type of system with coupled ordered-disordered chains has given rise to considerable interest recently, as it has a variety of applications in nanostructures and biological systems such as DNA molecules. We investigate the localization/delocalization of coupled one-dimensional systems composed of one disordered chain (chain I) and another ordered chain (chain II), focusing on the interplay among the disorder, correlation, and interchain coupling. We find that for systems where chain I exhibits uncorrelated disorder, charge transport in chain I (II) is enhanced (suppressed), as the disorder in chain I leads to the localization of all states in both chains. However, for chain I with hopping amplitude t1 and long-range correlated disorder (with power-law spectral density and disorder strength W), we find there is a localization/delocalization transition for the case W≤4 t1, induced by interchain coupling. For W>4 t1, we find there is a quantum-phase transition at finite interchain coupling Vc: The interchain coupling induces appearance of two channels of extended states for V> Vc while there is only one channel of extended states for V< Vc. © 2010 The American Physical Society."
2010-06-16,A stretching device for imaging real-time molecular dynamics of live cells adhering to elastic membranes on inverted microscopes during the entire process of the stretch,"We present a device for stretching cells adhering to elastic membranes in equiaxial or uniaxial mode, meanwhile allowing real-time imaging of molecular dynamics of live cells at high resolution on an inverted microscope during the entire process of the stretch. We obtained high-resolution images of stress fibers at each stage of the stretch, and found that stress fibers were shortened after one stretching cycle. We, for the first time, captured real-time images of the process of stress fiber disassembly during stretching. Several adjacent stress fibers appeared to reassemble into a single one after stretching. All these indicated that mechanical stretching played important roles in the rearrangement of actin filaments. This device will be especially useful in studies of the molecular dynamics in the process of mechanotransduction. The device is fabricated on a glass slide through a simple procedure and is adaptable to most ordinary laboratories. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry."
2010-06-15,Using ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC ICP-MS to simultaneously determine Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in urine of chromate workers,"Urinary chromium speciation analysis can provide available information of the individual exposure levels of Cr(VI) compounds. An analytical method based on ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC combined with ICP-MS to simultaneously determine Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in human urine has been developed for assessing the occupational exposure to chromate. The separation conditions of the method, including the pH value, the concentrations of ion-pair reagent and methanol in the mobile phase were studied. Specially, a high-speed polyetheretherketone (PEEK) column and a typical sample introduction method were employed to avoid the exogenous chromium contamination during the analysis. The separation of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) could be finished within 4 min with the detection limits as low as 0.03 μg L-1 at 100 μL injections for both of them, providing a convenient method for routine analysis of chromium species. The chromium species in urine of chromate workers were monitored using the developed method. The statistical analysis showed a significant relationship (n = 32, p < 0.01) between the urinary Cr(VI) and the individual airborne exposure levels, indicating that the urinary Cr(VI) could be used as a convenient and suitable monitor for high level Cr(VI) occupational exposure. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

2010-06-01,Toxicity of zinc oxide nanoparticles to zebrafish embryo: A physicochemical study of toxicity mechanism,"The biological impact of engineered nanomaterials released into the aquatic environment is a major concern. In this work, the properties of ZnO nanoparticles (nano-ZnO, 30 nm) were characterized in a water suspension (E3 medium), and a zebrafish 96-h post fertilization (hpf) embryo-larval test was performed to assess the toxicity of nano-ZnO suspension. Nano-ZnO was found to readily form aggregates with different sizes; small aggregates (142.4-517.7 nm) were still suspended in E3 medium, but large aggregates (>1 μm) quickly deposited on the bottom of 24-well plates; nano-ZnO was partially dissolved to Zn species (Zn(dis)) in E3 medium. In the nano-ZnO suspension, small aggregates, Zn(dis), and large aggregates might jointly exert influence on the development of zebrafish embryos. The embryo toxicity test revealed that nano-ZnO killed zebrafish embryos (50 and 100 mg/L), retarded the embryo hatching (1-25 mg/L), reduced the bodylength of larvae, and caused tail malformation after the 96 hpf exposure. Zn(dis) only partially contributed to the toxicity of nano-ZnO. This research highlights the need to further investigate the ecotoxicity of nano-ZnO in the water environment."
2010-05-25,Potent angiogenesis inhibition by the particulate form of fullerene derivatives,"Antiangiogenesis is an effective strategy for cancer treatment because uncontrolled tumor growth depends on tumor angiogenesis and sufficient blood supply. Great progress has been made in developing a ""molecular"" form of angiogenesis inhibitors; however, the narrow inhibition spectrum limits anticancer efficacy as those inhibitors that usually target a few or even a single angiogenic factor among many angiogenic factors might initially be effective but ultimately lead to the failure of the treatment due to the induction of expression of other angiogenic factors. In this work, we report that with a multiple hydroxyl groups functionalized surface, the Gd@C 82(OH)22 fullerenic nanoparticles (f-NPs) are capable of simultaneously downregulating more than 10 angiogenic factors in the mRNA level that is further confirmed at the protein level. After studying this antiangiogenesis activity of the f-NPs by cellular experiment, we further investigated its anticancer efficacy in vivo. A two-week treatment with the f-NPs decreased >40% tumor microvessels density and efficiently lowered the speed of blood supply to tumor tissues by ∼ 40%. Efficacy of the treatment using f-NPs in nude mice was comparable to the clinic anticancer drug paclitaxel, while no pronounced side effects were found. These findings indicate that the f-NPs with multiple hydroxyl groups serve as a potent antiangiogenesis inhibitor that can simultaneously target multiple angiogenic factors. We propose that using nanoscale ""particulate"" itself as a new form of medicine (particulate medicine) may be superior to the traditional ""molecular"" form of medicine (molecular medicine) in cancer treatment. © 2010 American Chemical Society."
2010-05-19,The big red shift of photoluminescence of Mn dopants in strained CdS: A case study of Mn-doped MnS-CdS heteronanostructures,"The red photoluminescence of Mn dopants in MnS-CdS heteronanostructures has been observed for the first time. The red photoluminescence at 650 nm derives from emission due to the 4T→ 6Atransition of Mn 2+ dopants in a CdS matrix exposed to gigapascal-level lattice stress. HRTEM, FFT, XRD, and optical studies revealed that the lattice of Mn-doped CdS is compressed to match that of MnS when CdS crystallizes at the MnS surface to form MnS-CdS heteronanostructures. The photoluminescence decay times of such Mn dopants are on the order of nanoseconds because of the spin-flip interactions between Mn dopants and free carriers in the CdS matrix. © 2010 American Chemical Society."

The structures and the properties of the new polymers, Gd@C82-PS, were investigated by GPC, UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR, 13C NMR, CV/DPV, and XPS. The polymerization behavior of the metallofullerene and the properties of the Gd@C82-PS polymers were different from those of C60-PS and PS. Gd@C82 exhibited a stronger radical-scavenging ability than that of hollow fullerenes in the polymerization. Molecular weights and the electron-accepting ability of the polymers were discussed and possible mechanisms of the influences were proposed. © 2010 American Chemical Society."
2010-05-01,Effects of ZnO nanoparticles on antioxidant enzyme system of zebrafish embryos,"The toxicity effects of nano-ZnO suspension on antioxidant enzyme system of zebrafish embryos were investigated for evaluating its potential ecotoxicity. Exposure to nano-ZnO suspension led to the decrease in glutathione (GSH) content, the inhibition in catalase (CAT) and superoxidase dismutase (SOD) activity, and the increase in MDA level of zebrafish embryo.The result demonstrates that oxidative stress was one of the mechanisms of nano-ZnO ecotoxicity."
2010-05-01,"Structures and electronic properties of M@Au<inf>6</inf> (M=Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ar) clusters: A density functional theory investigation","The geometries and electronic properties of the 3p electrons atoms doped gold cluster: M@Au6 clusters (M=Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ar) have been systematically investigated by using relativistic all-electron density functional theory (VPSR) and scalar relativistic effective core potential Stuttgart/Dresden (SDD) basis. Generalized gradient approximation in the Perdue-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional form is chosen for geometry optimization. A number of new isomers are obtained for neutral M@Au6 clusters. Both PBE/VPSR and PBE/SDD methods give similar lowest energy structure of each M@Au6cluster. With the exception of Ar@Au6, all doped clusters show larger relative binding energies compared with pure Au 7 cluster. It is found that all the ground-state structures of the M@Au6 clusters prefer the low symmetry structures, which is very different to the 3d transition-metal impurity doped Au6 clusters. Our results are in excellent agreement with available experiment data. © 2010 EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
2010-04-20,Metallofullerene nanoparticles circumvent tumor resistance to cisplatin by reactivating endocytosis,"Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic drug commonly used in clinics. However, acquired resistance confines its application in chemotherapeutics. To overcome the acquired resistance to cisplatin, it is reasoned, based on our previous findings of mediation of cellular responses by [Gd@C82(OH) 22]n nanoparticles, that [Gd@C82(OH)22]n may reverse tumor resistance to cisplatin by reactivating the impaired endocytosis of cisplatin-resistant human prostate cancer (CP-r) cells. Here we report that exposure of the CP-r PC-3-luc cells to cisplatin in the presence of nontoxic [Gd@C82(OH)22]n not only decreased the number of surviving CP-r cells but also inhibited growth of the CP-r tumors in athymic nude mice as measured by both optical and MRI. Labeling the CP-r PC-3 cells with transferrin, an endocytotic marker, demonstrated that pretreatment of the CP-r PC-3-luc cells with [Gd@C82(OH)22]n enhanced intracellular accumulation of cisplatin and formation of cisplatin-DNA adducts by restoring the defective endocytosis of the CP-r cancer cells. The results suggest that [Gd@C82(OH)22]n nanoparticles overcome tumor resistance to cisplatin by increasing its intracellular accumulation through the mechanism of restoring defective endocytosis. The technology can be extended to other challenges related to multidrug resistance often found in cancer treatments."
2010-04-12,"Enhanced exciton migration in electrospun poly[2-methoxy-5- (2′ -ethylhexyloxy)-1,4- phenylenevinylene]/poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) nanofibers","We present the studies on static and transient optical characteristics of electrospun poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′ -ethylhexyloxy)-1,4- phenylenevinylene]/ poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (MEH-PPV/PVP) nanofibers. [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester is mixed into the polymer matrix, working as quenchers to optical excitons. Comparing with the spin-coated films, the nanofibers exhibit enhanced exciton migration in speed and amplitude. The results are explained together with photoluminescent spectra blueshifting and longer exciton lifetime. Reduced aggregation and long-range order simultaneously induced by electric field are regarded as the mechanism for the phenomena. © 2010 American Institute of Physics."
2010-04-01,Loop-mediated isothermal amplification integrated on microfluidic chips for point-of-care quantitative detection of pathogens,"This work shows that loop-mediated isothermal amplifica-tion (LAMP) of nucleic acid can be integrated in an eight-channel microfluidic chip for readout either by the naked eye (as a result of the insoluble byproduct pyrophosphate generating during LAMP amplification) or via absorbance measured by an optic sensor; we call this system micro-LAMP (μLAMP). It is capable of analyzing target nucleic acids quantitatively with high sensitivity and specificity. The assay is straightforward in manipulation. It requires a sample volume of 0.4 μL and is complete within 1 h. The sensitivity of the assay is comparable to standard methods, where 10 fg of DNA sample could be detected under isothermal conditions (63 o°C). A real time quan-titative μLAMP assay using absorbance detection is pos-sible by integration of optical fibers within the chip. © 2010 American Chemical Society."
2010-03-24,Chemistry of carbon nanotubes in biomedical applications,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted great interdisciplinary interest due to their peculiar structural, mechanical and electronic properties. Applications of CNTs in biomedical research are being actively explored by many scientists worldwide. However, manipulation of CNTs is impeded by several problems, such as 1) formation of complex and entangled bundles; 2) very low solubility of CNTs in organic solvents and water; 3) inert properties of pristine CNTs under many chemical reaction conditions, etc. Chemical modification of CNTs has partly solved the above issues and is still one of the most effective means of manipulating and processing CNTs. Many bioapplications of CNTs rely on successful outer/inner surface functionalizations. This Feature Article is comprised of two main parts. In the first part, we briefly review the covalent surface chemistry for the CNT functionalization; in the second part, we focus on the biomedical applications of surface chemistry for CNTs, in particular, the chemistry for controlling biomedical functions and meanwhile lowering nanotoxicity of CNTs. We also analyze the underlying factors that led to the controversy in the previous experimental data of safety studies of CNTs. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry."
2010-03-12,Applications and toxicological issues surrounding nanotechnology in the food industry,"With the rapid development of nanotechnology, the presence of nanoparticles (NPs) in commercially available products is becoming more and more common. The field of food nanotechnology has experienced significant growth over the last five years. Agricultural cultivation, food processing, food packaging, food security, and water purification are examples of the important sectors linked with nanotechnology in the food production chain. However, safety concerns about such nanotechnology and the use of nanomaterials are increasing. Many determinants for the unusual activities and toxicities of the nanomaterials involving particle size, chemical composition, surface structure, and dosage are considered as well as three main exposure routes, including inhalation, ingestion, and dermal exposure. In addition, the trends and progress for toxicity and risk evaluation of the nanomaterials used in the food industry are also reviewed, which are helpful to understand and establish a regulatory system for the further development and use of NPs in the food industry. © 2010 IUPAC."
2010-03-08,Physico-chemical behaviour and algal toxicity of nanoparticulate CeO <inf>2</inf> in freshwater,"In assessing the risks posed by nanomaterials in the environment, the overriding research challenges are to determine if nanomaterials are more toxic than the bulk forms of the same material, and the extent to which toxicity is governed by particle size and reactivity. In this study, the toxicity of nanoparticulate CeO2 (nominally 1020 nm) to the freshwater alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata was compared to the same material at the micron size (nominally ≤ 5 μ m). Growth inhibition experiments revealed inhibitory concentration values, giving 50% reduction in algal growth rate after 72 h (IC50), of 10.3 ± 1.7 and 66 ± 22 mg L -1 for the nanoparticles and bulk materials respectively. Cells exposed to CeO2 particles were permeable to the DNA-binding dye SYTOX® Green in a concentration-dependent manner indicating damage to the cell membrane. Screening assays to assess the oxidative activity of the particles showed that the light illumination conditions used during standard algal bioassays are sufficient to stimulate photocatalytic activity of CeO2 particles, causing the generation of hydroxyl radicals and peroxidation of a model plant fatty acid. No oxidative activity or lipid peroxidation was observed in the dark. These findings indicate that inhibitory mode of action of CeO2 to P. subcapitata is mediated by a cell-particle interaction causing membrane damage. The effect is most likely photochemically induced and is enhanced for the nanoparticulate form of the CeO2.© CSIRO 2010."

Therefore investigation of their mechanical performance is of importance. The Young's modulus of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanofibers was analyzed by scanning probe microscopy (SPM) methods. Air plasma treatment was used to reduce the nanofibers to different sizes. Size-dependent mechanical properties of PVA nanofibers were studied and revealed that the Young's modulus increased dramatically when the scales became very small (<80 nm).

The precursor was obtained via precipitation route using Ti(SO4)2. The characterization of the as-prepared sample was confirmed by TEM, XRD, UV-Vis and low temperature N2 adsorption measurements(BET). The photocatalytic activity was also investigated by the degradation of methyl orange solutions. The particles of the as-synthesized sample with narrow size distribution had an average diameter of about 24 nm. The specific BET surface area of the as-synthesized sample was about 56 m 2·g-1, which is similar to the commercial TiO2(P25). The prepared materials showed the similar photocatalytic activity when compared with the performance of commercial TiO2(P25)."
2010-03-01,Therapeutic strategies underpinning the development of novel techniques for the treatment of HIV infection,"The HIV replication cycle offers multiple targets for chemotherapeutic intervention, including the viral exterior envelope glycoprotein, gp120; viral co-receptors CXCR4 and CCR5; transmembrane glycoprotein, gp41; integrase; reverse transcriptase; protease and so on. Most currently used anti-HIV drugs are reverse transcriptase inhibitors or protease inhibitors. The expanding application of simulation to drug design combined with experimental techniques have developed a large amount of novel inhibitors that interact specifically with targets besides transcriptase and protease. This review presents details of the anti-HIV inhibitors discovered with computer-aided approaches and provides an overview of the recent five-year achievements in the treatment of HIV infection and the application of computational methods to current drug design. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

2010-02-23,[Gd@C<inf>82</inf>(OH)<inf>22</inf>]<inf>n</inf> nanoparticles induce dendritic cell maturation and activate Th1 immune responses,"Dendritic cells play a pivotal role in host immune defense, such as elimination of foreign pathogen and inhibition of tumorigenesis. In this paper, we report that [Gd@C82(OH)22]n could induce phenotypic maturation of dendritic cells by stimulating DC production of cytokines including IL-12p70, upregulating DC co-stimulatory (CD80, CD83, and CD86) and MHC (HLA-A,B,C and HLA-DR) molecules, and switching DCs from a CCL5-responsive to a CCL19-responsive phenotype. We found that [Gd@C 82(OH)22]n can induce dendritic cells to become functionally mature as illustrated by their capacity to activate allogeneic T cells. Mice immunized with ovalbumin in the presence of [Gd@C 82(OH)22]n exhibit enhanced ovalbumin-specific Th1-polarized immune response as evidenced by the predominantly increased production of IFN-, IL-1-, and IL-2. The [Gd@C82(OH) 22]n nanoparticle is a potent activator of dendritic cells and Th1 immune responses.

2010-01-26,Use of a rapid cytotoxicity screening approach to engineer a safer zinc oxide nanoparticle through iron doping,"The establishment of verifiably safe nanotechnology requires the development of assessment tools to identify hazardous nanomaterial properties that could be modified to improve nanomaterial safety. While there is a lot of debate of what constitutes appropriate safety screening methods, one approach is to use the assessment of cellular injury pathways to collect knowledge about hazardous material properties that could lead to harm to humans and the environment. We demonstrate the use of a multiparameter cytotoxicity assay that evaluates toxic oxidative stress to compare the effects of titanium dioxide (TiO 2), cerium oxide (CeO 2), and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles in bronchial epithelial and macrophage cell lines. The nanoparticles were chosen on the basis of their volume of production and likelihood of spread to the environment. Among the materials, dissolution of ZnO nanoparticles and Zn 2+ release were capable of ROS generation and activation of an integrated cytotoxic pathway that includes intracellular calcium flux, mitochondrial depolarization, and plasma membrane leakage. These responses were chosen on the basis of the compatibility of the fluorescent dyes that contemporaneously assess their response characteristics by a semiautomated epifluorescence procedure. Purposeful reduction of ZnO cytotoxicity was achieved by iron doping, which changed the material matrix to slow Zn 2+ release. In summary, we demonstrate the utility of a rapid throughput, integrated biological oxidative stress response pathway to perform hazard ranking of a small batch of metal oxide nanoparticles, in addition to showing how this assay can be used to improve nanosafety by decreasing ZnO dissolution through Fe doping. © 2010 American Chemical Society."
2010-01-19,Fabrication of necklace-like structures via electrospinning,"We report a one-step method to fabricate necklace-like structures from zero-dimensional materials via electrospinning. PVA was used as polymer matrix for accomplishing necklace-like arrays of silica particles. We systemically investigated how the diameter of SiO2 particles, the weight ratio of PVA to SiO2, the voltage, and the relative content of PVA/SiO 2/H2O influenced the morphology of electrospun fibers. SiO2 particles with diameter of 143 nm tended to aggregate into bunches in the fibers, while 265 and 910 nm SiO2 particles tended to align along the fibers one by one, resembling necklaces. The content of water in the PVA/SiO2/H2O solution showed critical influence on the diameter of fibers and consequently determined the morphology. Too thin solutions gave birth to blackberry-like structure; too condensed solution was too hard to eject from the orifice of the needle; when the ingredient was elaborately tailored, we obtained necklace-like structures. We believe that these results can serve as references to generating other complex structures involving polymers and particles via electrospinning and that these structures will be potentially useful in photoelectric devices, drug release, and optical components. © 2009 American Chemical Society."
2010-01-15,"Probing the magnetic and structural properties of the 3d, 4d, 5d impurities encapsulated in an icosahedral Ag<inf>12</inf> cage","The geometries, electronic, and magnetic properties of the 3d, 4d, 5d impurities encapsulated in an icosahedral Ag12 cage have been systematically investigated by using relativistic all-electron density functional theory with generalized gradient approximation. The general features of the properties of 3d, 4d, 5d transition-metal atoms doped Ag12 clusters are probed and compared. It is found that the most stable structure for all M@Ag12 clusters (M=3d, 4d and 5d transition-metal atoms) is the icosahedral structure with Ih symmetries, in which the transition-metal atom is located in the center of the Ag12 cage. All doped clusters show larger relative binding energies compared with pure icosahedral Ag13 cluster, indicating that doping by 3d, 4d, 5d transition-metal atoms could stabilize the Ag12 icosahedron and form a new binary alloy cluster. The calculation of the magnetic properties demonstrates that the magnetic moments of M@Ag12 clusters vary from 0 to 4μB by doping different transition-metal atom into Ag12 icosahedron, suggesting that the transition-metal-doped Ag12 clusters could have potential utility in new nanomaterials as building blocks with tunable magnetic properties. © 2009 Elsevier B.V."

The photo-functionalization with 9-anthracenemethanol (anth) was tested using adsorption from solution, as well as dry and melt compounding. Rhodamine 6G Perchlorate (RhP) and Nile Blue A Perchlorate (NBAP) were adsorbed by cation exchange. XRD, TGA and spectrofluorimetry showed that cation exchange in water/ethanol at 80 °C, with an added amount of RhP corresponding to 25% of the initial surfactant content, followed by washing, recovering and drying, yielded the best results. The intercalation of the fluorescent dyes rearranged the paraffinic structure of the surfactant molecules by increasing the tilting angle from 37° to 49°. © 2010 Elsevier B.V."

2010-01-01,"Characterization of gold nanorods in vivo by integrated analytical techniques: Their uptake, retention, and chemical forms","Integrated analytical techniques were used to study the tissue distribution and structural information of gold nanorods (Au NRs) in Sprague-Dawley rats through tail intravenous injection. Before in vivo experiments were conducted, careful characterization of Au NRs was performed. The zeta potential proved that adsorption of bovine serum albumin on Au NRs turned the surface charges from positive to negative as in an in vitro simulation. The biodistribution of Au NRs was investigated quantitatively by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry at different time points after injection. As target tissues, both liver and spleen were chosen to further demonstrate the intracellular localization of Au NRs by the combination of transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Moreover, synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy was employed and it was observed that long-term retention of Au NRs in liver and spleen did not induce obvious changes in the oxidation states of gold. Therefore, the present systematic method can provide important information about the fates of Au NRs in vivo and can also be extended to study the biological effects of other metallic nanomaterials in the future. © 2009 Springer-Verlag."

The electrical mobility diameters of the generated particles are ranging from 9 to 19 nm for Pt, 9 to 90 nm for TiO2, and 15 to 90 nm for graphite. Toward this purpose, two specific test benches were used: one for the filter-based devices which are tested under a controlled air flow, and the other one for protective clothing and gloves under diffusion and without air flow. Different types of nanoaerosols, such as TiO2, Pt, and graphite, were generated. Electrostatic and HEPA (High Efficiency Particle Air) filters have shown the highest efficiency for graphite nanoparticles. The main hypothesis for explaining this effect is that electrostatic forces could enhance the graphite nanoparticles capture. Air-tight fabrics made of non-woven textile seem much more efficient in protecting workers against Pt, and TiO2 nanoparticles than cotton and polypropylene. With regard to protective clothing, no obvious effect linked to the aerosol type was observed. Gloves are found very efficient for TiO2 and Pt nanoaerosols. Therefore, no effect of aerosol on the protection efficiency of gloves was evidenced. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."
2010-01-01,Circumventing tumor resistance to chemotherapy by nanotechnology.,"Patient relapse and metastasis of malignant cells is very common after standard cancer treatment with surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Chemotherapy, a cornerstone in the development of present day cancer therapy, is one of the most effective and potent strategies to treat malignant tumors. However, the resistance of cancer cells to the drugs remains a significant impediment to successful chemotherapy. An additional obstacle is the inability of chemotherapeutic drugs to selectively target tumor cells. Almost all the anticancer agents have severe side effects on normal tissues and organs. The toxicity of currently available anticancer drugs and the inefficiency of chemotherapeutic treatments, especially for advanced stages of the disease, have limited the optimization of clinical drug combinations and effective chemotherapeutic protocols. Nanomedicine allows the release of drugs by biodegradation and self-regulation of nanomaterials in vitro and in vivo. Nanotechnologies are characterized by effective drug encapsulation, controllable self-assembly, specificity and biocompatibility as a result of their own material properties. Nanotechnology has the potential to overcome current chemotherapeutic barriers in cancer treatment, because of the unique nanoscale size and distinctive bioeffects of nanomaterials. Nanotechnology may help to solve the problems associated with traditional chemotherapy and multidrug resistance."
2010-01-01,Personal protective equipment against nanoparticles,"Nanomaterials manufacture and use are in full expansion. With them comes an increasing risk for human health, especially at the workplace. Indeed, the early signs of potential toxicity associated with nanotechnologies are piling up. Even if they must be considered as a last resource in a traditional occupational Health & Safety approach, personal protective equipment (PPE) against nanoparticles need to be available right away, while the other more upstream risk management strategies are developed, assessed and put into action. However, the current picture of the situation relative to PPE against nanoparticles is rather worrying. For one part, there is an almost complete void worldwide in terms of regulations, standard testing methods and selection guides relative to PPE against nanoparticles. In addition, even if most claim that certified respirators should offer the needed level of protection against nanoparticles, large uncertainties remain, in particular in relation with the thermal rebound effect reported by some researchers for particles as large as 20 nm, as well as the high potential of inward leaks at interfaces. In terms of protective clothing and gloves, the subject is largely unexplored, maybe because of the common belief that skin is an impervious membrane and that protective clothing against chemical risks is efficient in case of exposure to nanoparticles. Yet, both assertions are questioned by recent findings, demonstrating the urgent need for more research in this area. Copyright © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."
2010-01-01,Effects of rare earth oxide nanoparticles on root elongation of plants,"The phytotoxicity of four rare earth oxide nanoparticles, nano-CeO2, nano-La2O3, nano-Gd2O3 and nano-Yb2O3 on seven higher plant species (radish, rape, tomato, lettuce, wheat, cabbage, and cucumber) were investigated in the present study by means of root elongation experiments. Their effects on root growth varied greatly between different nanoparticles and plant species. A suspension of 2000 mg L-1 nano-CeO2 had no effect on the root elongation of six plants, except lettuce. On the contrary, 2000 mg L-1 suspensions of nano-La2O3, nano-Gd2O3 and nano-Yb2O3 severely inhibited the root elongation of all the seven species. Inhibitory effects of nano-La2O3, nano-Gd2O3, and nano-Yb2O3 also differed in the different growth process of plants. For wheat, the inhibition mainly took place during the seed incubation process, while lettuce and rape were inhibited on both seed soaking and incubation process. The fifty percent inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for rape were about 40 mg L-1 of nano-La2O3, 20 mg L-1 of nano-Gd2O3, and 70 mg L-1 of nano-Yb2O3, respectively. In the concentration ranges used in this study, the RE3+ ion released from the nanoparticles had negligible effects on the root elongation. These results are helpful in understanding phytotoxicity of rare earth oxide nanoparticles. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

2009-12-14,Electrospinning of poly(dimethylsiloxane)/poly(methyl methacrylate) nanofibrous membrane: Fabrication and application in protein microarrays,"Fabrication of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) nanofibers is critical to harness the advantage of nanostructured membrane applied in protein microarrays. Electrospinning (ES) of PDMS nanofibers is challenging because of the relatively low molecular weight of PDMS prepolymer. We report a strategy to fabricate PDMS/PMMA nanofibers via ES by introducing carrier polymer PMMA into PDMS solutions to supplement the deficiency of chain entanglements in the PDMS prepolymer. The prepared PDMS/PMMA nanofibrous membrane (PDMS/PMMA NFM) was successfully used as substrates for protein microarrays. The results of immunoassays showed the superior performance of PDMS/PMMA NFM as 3D substrate for protein microarrays; the limit-of-detection (LOD) on PDMS/PMMA NFM was 32 times lower than that on nitrocellulose membrane. The realization of ES PDMS extends the scope of ES materials from thermoplastic polymers to thermosetting materials. Given the simplicity, low cost, and high efficiency of ES technology, we believe that PDMS/PMMA NFM is a promising 3D substrate for protein microarrays. © 2009 American Chemical Society."

However, while the prefix nano has leaked into popular language, its very concept is still unclear to most people. Nanotechnology is innovative in character; it is currently moving from the laboratory to industrial manufacturing and marketing; significant public and private investments are going into development and promotion; and the anticipated benefits are considerable. For all of these reasons, the Québec Commission de l'éthique de la science et de la technologie (CEST) has decided to explore nanotechnology from an ethical perspective and to publish a position statement on the subject. For the purpose of a global reflection on nanotechnology, the Commission has deemed important to consider such aspects as the size of nanometric particles, the means of manipulating materials (top-down and bottom-up), multidisciplinary approaches and the convergence of disciplines with respect to nanotechnology as well as a general fascination with nanotechnology.

The new field of nanosafety has emerged and need to be explored now rather than after problems become so ubiquitous and difficult to treat that their trend become irreversible. Such endeavour necessitates a transdisciplinary approach. A commonly forgotten and/or misunderstood risk is that of explosion/detonation of nanopowders, due to their high specific active surface areas. Such risk is emphasized and illustrated with the present development of an appropriate risk analysis. For this particular risk, a review of characterization methods and their limitations with regard to nanopowders is presented and illustrated for a few organic and metallic nanopowders."

2009-11-26,Measurement of nanofiller removal by abrasion,"In the frame of the European NanoSafe2 project, CEA designed and qualified a specific bench test to measure the release of nanofillers from nanomaterials. In the proposed set up the material to be tested is mechanically solicited by abrasion using a normalized Taber equipment. The sensitivity of the method has been drastically optimized by reducing the background noise counts and the streaming air flow. The results show that even materials without any nanofiller can generate nanoparticles when submitted to abrasion. Furthermore, tests show that nanofillers can be released in usage by abrasion for non optimised nanoproducts. This confirms the interest to develop such a method. The normalized abrasion process itself is critical for the removal and the aérosolisation of the nanoparticles which both drive the sensitivity of the method. The abrasion process has to be optimized in a realistic and consensual way for standardization."

The apoptosis of cerebral microvessel endothelial cells (CMECs) induced by oxidative stress injury plays a key role in the dysfunction of BBB. By use of CMECs as an in vitro BBB model, we show for the first time that C60(C(COOH)2)2 nanoparticles can selectively enter oxidized CMECs rather than normal cells, and maintain CMECs integrity by attenuating H2O2-induced F-actin depolymerization via the observation of several state-of-the art microscopic techniques. Additionally, we have found that C60(C(COOH) 2)2 nanoparticles greatly inhibit the apoptosis of CMECs induced by H2O2, which is related to their modulation of the JNK pathway. C60(C(COOH)2)2 nanoparticles can regulate several downstream signaling events related to the JNK pathway, including reduction of JNK phosphorylation, activation of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and caspase-3, and inhibition of polyADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Our results indicate that C60(C(COOH)2)2 nanoparticles possess a novel ability of selectively entering oxidation-damaged cerebral endothelial cells rather than normal endothelial cells and then protecting them from apoptosis. © 2009 American Chemical Society."

Zhang et al.,The purpose of the present study is to develop a new method to prepare magnetite chitosan microspheres conjugated with methotrexate (MTX) for the controlled release of MTX as a magnetic targeting drug delivery system. MTX was first conjugated to the chitosan chain via a peptide bond and then a suspension cross-linking technique was used for the production of magnetic chitosan microspheres with glutaraldehyde as the cross-linker. The MTX-loading capacity of the magnetic chitosan microspheres was determined and drug release experiments were also carried out to discuss the MTX release behavior. All the data support that the magnetic chitosan-MTX microspheres prepared in this method would have great potential application in magnetic targeting drug delivery technology. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd.
2009-11-04,Charge transport in DNA molecules: Cooperative interplay between the disordered base-pair channel and the ordered backbone,"Charge transport in DNA molecules has raised considerable interest because of its importance in biological processes and potential applications in nanoscale devices. A DNA molecule can be viewed as a quasi-one-dimensional system composed of stacked base pairs (AT, CG) together with backbones of sugar phosphates. Motivated by recent experimental observations on the importance of the backbone integrity, we investigate the interplay between charge transport through the ordered backbone and disordered base stacks with random sequences. By analytical and numerical calculations, we find that the coupling between the backbone and base-pair channels plays an important role in charge transport. The backbone can generate effective hopping constants well beyond the adjacent base pairs, enhancing charge transport through the base-pair channel. The corresponding enhancement of the localization length is nearly independent of the length of the DNA and increases with increasing coupling between backbone and base pair. Our model can explain qualitatively several experimental observations. © 2009 The American Physical Society."

The bioactivities of these chemical entities are described. The 'Yin and Yang' theory and the fundamentals of the 'five elements' applied to the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are concisely introduced to help readers understand how ginseng balances the dynamic equilibrium of human physiological processes from the TCM perspectives. This paper concerns the observation and experimental investigation of biological activities of ginseng used in the TCM of past and present cultures. The current biological findings of ginseng and its medical applications are narrated and critically discussed, including 1) its antihyperglycemic effect that may benefit type II diabetics; in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated protection of ginseng on beta-cells and obese diabetic mouse models. The related clinical trial results are stated. 2) its aphrodisiac effect and cardiovascular effect that partially attribute to ginseng's bioactivity on nitric oxide (NO); 3) its cognitive effect and neuropharmacological effect that are intensively tested in various rat models using purified ginsenosides and show a hope to treat Parkinson's disease (PD); 4) its uses as an adjuvant or immunotherapeutic agent to enhance immune activity, appetite and life quality of cancer patients during their chemotherapy and radiation. Although the apoptotic effect of ginsenosides, especially Rh2, Rg3 and Compound K, on various tumor cells has been shown via different pathways, their clinical effectiveness remains to be tested.

This microchip enables the detection of multiple pairs of protein-protein interactions in one experiment by crossing parallel arrays of microchannels. This chip uses ESPVDF membrane with high specific surface area as the substrate to adsorb protein for immobilized immunoassays so that increased levels of protein adsorption may lower the LOD in immunoassays. We employ a simple and effective method for chip assembly by scotch tape to incorporate the ESPVDF membrane into the microchip. We believe that the present work will facilitate the development of methods for the on-site diagnosis of diseases whose detection is based on antigen-antibody recognition, and improve the efficiencies of certain experiments that need to identify tens to hundreds of protein-protein interactions with relatively low cost in the future. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

2009-09-01,"Nanoparticles: Their potential toxicity, waste and environmental management","This literature review discusses specific issues related to handling of waste containing nanomaterials. The aims are (1) to highlight problems related to uncontrolled release of nanoparticles to the environment through waste disposal, and (2) to introduce the topics of nanowaste and nanotoxicology to the waste management community. Many nanoparticles used by industry contain heavy metals, thus toxicity and bioaccumulation of heavy metals contained in nanoparticles may become important environmental issues. Although bioavailability of heavy metals contained in nanoparticles can be lower than those present in soluble form, the toxicity resulting from their intrinsic nature (e.g. their size, shape or density) may be significant. An approach to the treatment of nanowaste requires understanding of all its properties - not only chemical, but also physical and biological. Progress in nanowaste management also requires studies of the environmental impact of the new materials. The authors believe Amara's law is applicable to the impact of nanotechnologies, and society might overestimate the short-term effects of these technologies, while underestimating the long-term effects. It is necessary to have basic information from companies about the level and nature of nanomaterials produced or emitted and about the expectation of the life cycle time of nanoproducts as a basis to estimate the level of nanowaste in the future. Without knowing how companies plan to use and store recycled and nonrecycled nanomaterials, development of regulations is difficult.

In this study, the impact of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nano-TiO2) on the phyllosphere bacterial community were analysed by both a culturable-dependent method and a polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) method. The quantity of culturable phyllosphere bacteria was significantly reduced with an increased concentration of nano-TiO2. With increasing concentrations from 0.002 to 20 mg/ml of nano-TiO2, the quantity of culturable phyllosphere bacteria decreased from 1.8×106 to 3.1×105 cfu/g. The phyllosphere bacteria community was analysed by PCR-DGGE, and when the concentrations of nano-TiO2 were higher than 0.02 mg/ml, the DGGE bands were significantly lower than in the control. Sequencing results of the bands from the DGGE gel showed that there were at least seven genera in the phyllosphere bacteria. Only one uncultured bacterium was unaffected by the concentration of nano-TiO2. © China Agricultural University 2009."
2009-08-01,Overexpression of mitochondrial ferritin sensitizes cells to oxidative stress via an iron-mediated mechanism,"Mitochondrial ferritin (MtFt) is a newly identified H-ferritin-like protein expressed only in mitochondria. Previous studies have shown that its overexpression markedly affects intracellular iron homeostasis and rescues defects caused by frataxin deficiency. To assess how MtFt exerts its function under oxidative stress conditions, MtFt overexpressing cells were treated with tert-butyl-hydroperoxide (tBHP), and the effects of MtFt expression on cell survival and iron homeostasis were examined. We found that MtFt expression was associated with decreased mitochondrial metabolic activity and reduced glutathione levels as well as a concomitant increase in reactive oxygen species levels and apoptosis. Moreover, mechanistic studies demonstrated that tBHP treatment led to a prolonged decrease in cytosolic ferritins levels in MtFt-expressing cells, while ferritin levels recovered to basal levels in control counterparts. tBHP treatment also resulted in elevated transferrin receptors, followed by more iron acquisition in MtFt expressing cells. The high molecular weight desferrioxamine, targeting to lysosomes, as well as the hydrophobic iron chelator salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone significantly attenuated tBHP-induced cell damage. In conclusion, the current study indicates that both the newly acquired iron from the extracellular environment and internal iron redistribution from ferritin degradation may be responsible for the increased sensitivity to oxidative stress in MtFt-expressing cells. © Copyright 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2009."

Here we report that poly-hydroxylated metallofullerenol (Gd@C82(OH)22) has biomedical functions useful in anticancer therapy arising from immunomodulatory effects observed both in vivo and in vitro. We found that metallofullerenol can inhibit the growth of tumors, and shows specific immunomodulatory effects on T cells and macrophages. These effects include polarizing the cytokine balance towards Th1 (T-helper cell type 1) cytokines, decreasing the production of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6), and increasing the production of Th1 cytokines (IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF-α) in the serum samples. Immune-system regulation by this nanomaterial showed dose-dependent behavior: at a low concentration, Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles slightly affected the activity of immune cells in vitro, while at a high concentration, they markedly enhanced immune responses and stimulated immune cells to release more cytokines, helping eliminate abnormal cells. Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles stimulated T cells and macrophages to release significantly greater quantities of TNF-α, which plays a key role in cellular immune processes. Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles are more effective in inhibiting tumor growth in mice than some clinical anticancer drugs but have negligible side effects. The underlying mechanism for high anticancer activity may be attributed to the fact that this water-soluble nanomaterial effectively triggers the host immune system to scavenge tumor cells. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

2009-07-22,Oxidation unzipping of stable nanographenes into joint spin-rich fragments,"When an all-benzenoid nanographene is linearly unzipped into oxygen-joined fragments, the oxidized benzenoid rings (aromatic sextets) selectively adopt the low-spin (ΔS = 0) or high-spin conformation (ΔS = 1) to yield the thermally most stable isomer. The selection of the conformation depends simply on the position of the aromatic sextets: the inner ones prefer the high-spin conformation, whereas the peripheral ones prefer the low-spin conformation. Therefore, the resulting most stable isomer has a total spin whose value equals the number of inner aromatic sextets (ni) along the oxidizing line. The nanographene fragments contained in this isomer have a ferromagnetic spin coupling. Due to the tautomerization between the high-spin and low-spin conformations, there also exist other possible isomers with higher energies and with spins at ground state ranging from 0 to (ni - 1). The rich geometrically correlated spins and the adjustable energy gaps indicate great potential of the graphene oxides in spintronic devices. © 2009 American Chemical Society."
2009-07-06,Nanotechnology in food production: Advances and problems,"Presented article is a review of the modern data on nanotechnology use in food manufacturing. There are discussed the basic scopes of nanotechnology application in food industry. One of the main problems arising in connection with introduction of nanotechnology in food, is an absence of reliable methods of identification and the control of nanoparticles is in structure of foodstuff including the control of their authenticity. Other problem is connected to necessity of an estimation of the risks connected to presence of potentially toxic nanoparticles in food. The analysis of foreign experience of researches in the given area alloies to formulate methodological approaches to formation of domestic system of nanosafety."

2009-06-30,Mre11-Rad50-Nbs complex is required to cap telomeres during Drosophila embryogenesis,"Using Drosophila as a model system, we identified here a stringent requirement for Mre11-Rad50-Nbs (MRN) function in telomere protection during early embryonic development. Animals homozygous for hypomorphic mutations in either mre11 or nbs develop normally with minimal telomere dysfunction. However, they produce inviable embryos that succumb to failure of mitosis caused by covalent fusion of telomeric DNA. Interestingly, the molecular defect is not the absence of MRN interaction or of Mre11 nuclease activities, but the depletion of the maternal pool of Nbs protein in these embryos. Because of Nbs depletion, Mre11 and Rad50 (MR) are excluded from chromatin. This maternal effect lethality in Drosophila is similar to that seen in mice carrying hypomorphic mrn mutations found in human patients, suggesting a common defect in telomere maintenance because of the loss of MRN integrity."
2009-06-29,Fullerene derivatives protect endothelial cells against NO-induced damage,"Functional fullerene derivatives have been demonstrated with potent antioxidation properties. Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical that plays a part in leading to brain damage when it is accumulated to a high concentration. The possible scavenging activity of NO by the hydroxylated fullerene derivative C60(OH)22 and malonic acid derivative C 60(C(COOH)2)2 was investigated using primary rat brain cerebral microvessel endothelial cells (CMECs). Results demonstrate that sodium nitroprusside (SNP), used as an NO donor, caused a marked decrease in cell viability and an increase in apoptosis. However, fullerene derivatives can remarkably protect against the apoptosis induced by NO assault. In addition, fullerene derivatives can also prevent NO-induced depolymerization of cytoskeleton and damage of the nucleus and accelerate endothelial cell repair. Further investigation shows that the sudden increase of the intercellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by NO was significantly attenuated by post-treatment with fullerene derivatives. Our results suggest that functional fullerene derivatives are potential applications for NO-related disorders. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd."
2009-06-01,Fabrication and photocatalytic activity of Pt-inserted titania nanotubes,"Titania nanotubes (TNTs) were synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of rutile-phase TiO2 nanoparticals in NaOH solution at 110°C for 24 hours. After drying in aceton for 36 h, the TNTs were under vacuum drying for 24 h at room temperature. The Pt-inserted titania nanotubes (Pt/TNTs) were obtained by filling H2PtCl6 ethanol solution into the TNTs after vacuum drying. The characterizations of the as-synthesized samples were confirmed by TEM, XRD, and UV-Vis. The photocatalytic activity of the Pt/TNTs was investigated by photo-induced decomposition of methyl orange (MO) under the main 365 nm UV-light. In order to comparison, the photocatalytic activity of both the rutile-phase TiO2 nanoparticles and pure TNTs were also investigated at the same time under the same experimental conditions. The TEM images show that the TNTs are hollow, a few hundred nanometers long, and the inner/outer diameter is about 6/10 nm. The crystal structure of TNTs is H2Ti2O5·H2O with a little Na. Both the shape and the crystalline of the TNTs are not changed after the modification. The oval or round Pt0 nanoparticals, about 3 nm in diameter, are found only in the nanotubes. Pt/TNTs exhibit enhanced absorption at the visible range in the UV-Vis spectra and its start absorption band edge (λ0≈457 nm) is obviously redshifted compared to the rutile-phase TiO2 nanoparticals and pure TNTs. The Pt nanoparticles are found to significantly enhance the photocatalytic activity of TNTs. Pt/TNTs are demonstrated to be highly efficient for the UV-light induced photocatalytic decomposition of MO compared to both the rutile-phase TiO2 nanoparticals and pure TNTs. After irradiation for 60 min, the photocatalysis decomposition rate of MO in rutile-phase TiO2 nanoparticals, TNTs and Pt/TNTs are 46.8%, 57.2% and 84.6% respectively."
2009-05-15,Characterization of the ATPase activity of a novel chimeric fusion protein consisting of the two nucleotide binding domains of MRP1,"Nucleotide Binding Domains (NBDs) are responsible for the ATPase activity of the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1). A series of NBD1-linker-NBD2 chimeric fusion proteins were constructed, expressed and purified, and their ATPase activities were analyzed. We report here that a GST linked NBD1642-890-GST-NBD21286-1531 was able to hydrolyze ATP at a rate of about 4.6 nmol/mg/min (Km = 2.17 mM, Vmax = 12.36 nmol/mg/min), which was comparable to the purified and reconstituted MRP1. In contrast, neither a mixture of NBD1 and GST-NBD2 nor the NBD1-GST-NBD1 fusion protein showed detectable ATPase activity. Additionally, the E1455Q mutant was found to be nonfunctional. Measurements by both MIANS labeling and circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed significant conformational differences in the NBD1-GST-NBD2 chimeric fusion protein compared to the mixture of NBD1 and GST-NBD2. The results suggest a direct interaction mediated by GST between the two NBDs of MRP1 leading to conformational changes which would enhance its ATPase activity. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

2009-05-01,Financial disclosure and toxic products: Encouraging wall street to anticipate product risk and exercise precaution,"Amidst discussion by policymakers about how regulators’ failure to ensure disclosure of risks contributed to the current financial crisis, we assess how emerging product toxicity risks are addressed in companies’ financial reports. Will corporations blindside investors with “the next asbestos?” Existing disclosures are found lacking in the specificity needed to forewarn of liabilities and reputational damage from the use of potentially harmful materials— from nanotechnologies, to asthmagens, to perfluorinated compounds. Improved standards could protect investors while also enhancing corporate incentives to use safer materials. Reforms by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board are recommended."

2009-04-15,Electrochemistry of symmetrical fullerene dimer C<inf>121</inf> film modified electrodes,"C121 and C121/didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) film modified electrodes have been constructed and their electrochemistry has been studied. In the acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate, the C121 films show three couples of relatively stable redox peaks corresponding to three two-electron transfer processes involving reduction of two fullerene units in the dimers. In an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium bromide, the C121 films display an irreversible reduction peak, whereas the C121/DDAB films display two couples of quasi-reversible redox peaks with the splitting first peak, and the C121/DDAB films have good reversibility and stability in the aqueous solution due to existence of DDAB. All of these experimental results indicate that voltammetric behaviors of the C121 films are different from those of C60 films due to different structures though C121 is carbon-bridged C60 dimer, and the common characteristics are that their electrochemical behaviors are dependent on the nature of solvent and cation of supporting electrolyte. Furthermore, electrocatalysis of H2O2 at the C121/DDAB films was explored in the aqueous solution, which indicates that C121 is a good electron-transfer mediator. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For the first time, molecular dynamics simulations show that the bilayer structure of DWCNTs is advantageous for carbon nanotube based transmembrane channels. The shielding of the amphiphilic outer layer could guarantee blocompatlblllty of the synthetic channel and protect the Inner tube (functional part) from disturbance of the membrane environment.

Three bands are resolved in the valence band region. The first band for n-type BGG is sensitive to temperature, while the second band is sensitive for p-type BGG. The change in the ratio of Ba to Ga, from which the carrier type is controlled in this system, modifies the positions of Ga residing at the larger (Ga-CGe)24 cage. This modification in the host network is responsible for the large differences observed in electronic properties of p- and n-BGGs in this clathrate family. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The surface chemical component, structure and bond of uncoated and dextran-coated nanoparticles were measured by synchrotraon radiation XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). Qualitative and quantitative analysis of Cls and Ols of Fe3O4 and dextran-Fe3O4 showed that the Fe3O4 nanoparticles were successively coated by sodium citrate via Fe-O-C bond, and dextrans, which can be linked with their carboxylate moiety via hydrogen bond. Sodium citrate could enhance the disperse stability of reaction system and hydrophilicity of dextran-Fe3O4."
2009-04-01,Influence of titanium dioxide nanoparticles on speciation and bioavailability of arsenite,"In this study, the influence of the co-existence of TiO2 nanoparticles on the speciation of arsenite [As(III)] was studied by observing its adsorption and valence changing. Moreover, the influence of TiO2 nanoparticles on the bioavailability of As(III) was examined by bioaccumulation test using carp (Cyprinus carpio). The results showed that TiO2 nanoparticles have a significant adsorption capacity for As (III). Equilibrium was established within 30 min, with about 30% of the initial As (III) being adsorbed onto TiO2 nanoparticles. Most of aqueous As (III) was oxidized to As(V) in the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles under sunlight. The carp accumulated considerably more As in the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles than in the absence of TiO2 nanoparticles, and after 25-day exposure, As concentration in carp increased by 44%. Accumulation of As in viscera, gills and muscle of the carp was significantly enhanced by the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Their novel functions have been well investigated in basic science, and many uses/applications have been reported in the environmental and biomedical fields. Therefore, understanding the processes of their cellular interactions with living cells is of significant importance for exploiting their applications in biomedical fields. In particular, if they could enter the cell, the process of internalization, their localization in intracellular compartments, and their succedent effects on the cellular functions, the current findings for these aspects are summarized in this paper.

Pulmonary retention and extrapulmonary redistribution of inhaled nanoparticles have been considered to be important contributing factors of cardiorespiratory diseases. In the present work, 22-nm 59Fe2O3 nanoparticles (radioactive isotope 59 <Fe-labeled ferric oxide nanoparticles) were intratracheally instilled into the male Sprague-Dawley rats at a dose of 4 mg/rat. Extrapulmonary distribution of 59Fe2O3 in organs and its metabolism in lung, blood, urine, and feces were measured for 50 days of exposure. Phagocytosis and clearance of agglomerated nano-Fe2 O3 by monocytes/macrophages were observed by histopathology and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry examination. Our results showed intratracheal-instilled nano-59Fe2 O3 could pass through the alveolar-capillary barrier into systemic circulation within 10 min that consisted with one-compartment kinetic model. The nano-59Fe2O3 in the lung was distributed to organs rich in mononuclear phagocytes, including liver, spleen, kidney and testicle. The plasma elimination half-life of nano-59Fe2O3 was 22.8 days and the lung clearance rate was 3.06 μg/day, indicating the systemic accumulation and lung retention had occurred. The deposited nano-Fe2 O3 in interstitial lung was probably contributed by the particles escaping from alveolar macrophages phagocytosis and macrophages clearance function overloading. Our results suggest that the effect of Fe2O3 nanoparticles exposure, even at low concentration, should be assessed because of the potential lung and systemic cumulative toxicity of the nanoparticles. © The Author 2008.

The self- assembled formation of C60-C-C60-C-C from C60-C-C60 was found to be an isomer- selective process. The results offer a valuable access to C60-based new materials of diverse functionalities, and an implication to the large scale utilization of C60 in polymerscience.

Chemotaxis plays a vital role in cancer cell metastasis. In the current study, we reported that epidermal growth factor (EGF) induced a robust chemotaxis of A549 and H1299 cells, two representative human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Chelerythrine chloride, an inhibitor of all protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes, significantly reduced the chemotactic capacity of NSCLC cells while inhibitors of classical or novel PKC isozymes, such as Gö6976, calphostin C, or Gö6850, showed no effect, which suggested that atypical PKC might be involved in the chemotactic process of NSCLC cells. EGF-elicited translocation and phosphorylation of atypical PKCζ, indicating that EGF could activate PKCζ. Treatment with a PKCζ specific inhibitor, a myristoylated pseudosubstrate, blocked the chemotaxis in a dose-dependent manner, further confirming that atypical PKCζ was required for NSCLC chemotaxis. Mechanistic studies suggested that PKCζ was regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt. Furthermore, PKCζ-mediated chemotaxis by regulating actin polymerization and cell adhesion. Taken together, our study suggested that PKCζ was required in NSCLC cell chemotaxis, thus could be used as a target to develop anti-lung cancer metastasis therapies. © 2008."
2009-02-01,The scavenging of reactive oxygen species and the potential for cell protection by functionalized fullerene materials,"We demonstrated that three different types of water-soluble fullerenes materials can intercept all of the major physiologically relevant ROS. C60(C(COOH)2)2, C60(OH)22, and Gd@C82(OH)22 can protect cells against H2O2-induced oxidative damage, stabilize the mitochondrial membrane potential and reduce intracellular ROS production with the following relative potencies: Gd@C82(OH)22 ≥ C60(OH)22 > C60(C(COOH)2)2. Consistent with their cytoprotective abilities, these derivatives can scavenge the stable 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl radical (DPPH), and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) superoxide radical anion (O2{radical dot}-), singlet oxygen, and hydroxyl radical (HO{radical dot}), and can also efficiently inhibit lipid peroxidation in vitro. The observed differences in free radical-scavenging capabilities support the hypothesis that both chemical properties, such as surface chemistry induced differences in electron affinity, and physical properties, such as degree of aggregation, influence the biological and biomedical activities of functionalized fullerenes. This represents the first report that different types of fullerene derivatives can scavenge all physiologically relevant ROS. The role of oxidative stress and damage in the etiology and progression of many diseases suggests that these fullerene derivatives may be valuable in vivo cytoprotective and therapeutic agents. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd."

In order to secure the global process of nanoparticle production, we investigate the liquid recovery of the raw powders. The goal was to recover the nanopowders directly in water at the exit of the reaction zone mainly for safety reasons. For that, the dispersion of TiO2 nanopowder in water using a dispersing agent was optimized and comparison of the powder characteristics produced after a dry or a liquid recovery was done. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd."
2009-01-01,"Guidelines for safe handling, use and disposal of nanoparticles","Health, safety and environmental (HSE) risks of a technology is an inseparable part of it which threatens all exposed employees. It has been proved for many years that exposure to particles, in an occupational setting, could be linked with the onset of lung diseases, such as pneumoconiosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and mesotelioma and lung cancer. Nanoparticles, due to their unique characteristics including; small size, shape, high surface area, charge, chemical properties, solubility, and degree of agglomeration can cross cell boundaries or pass directly from the lungs into the blood stream and ultimately reach to all of the organs in the body. This is the reason why they may pose higher risk than the same mass and material of larger particles. Moreover, biodegradation of nanoparticles by some kinds of fungi (like wood decay fungi) may result in metabolites which may be toxic to microorganisms under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Bacteria and living cells can take up nanoparticles, providing the basis for potential bioaccumulation in the food chain. Considering Iran's prominent position in nanotechnologies and fast-growing in research and industrial activities, controlling nanoparticles related HSE risks should be highly considered. In general, there are three main approaches to risk and exposure control: engineering techniques, administrative means and personal protective equipments. These complementary approaches especially engineering techniques should be considered starting with the design stage of an industrial process. Administrative means of control constitute an additional approach when the other methods have not achieved the expected control levels. Administrative means of control must never substitute for engineering techniques, which always be performed according to standard practices. In some situations, due to insufficiently advanced technology and prohibitive costs, engineering measerus can not be implemended. In these situations, performing administrative means of control constitute other ways of limiaiting the occupational exposure risks. Accordingly, to minimize the risks from know and unknown health, safety and invironment hazards in research and occupational setting of the country, guideline for safe handling, use and disposal of manopractical has provided. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd."
2009-01-01,Explosion risks from nanomaterials,"Emerging nanomanufactured products are being incorporated in a variety of consumer products ranging from closer body contact products (i.e. cosmetics, sunscreens, toothpastes, pharmaceuticals, clothing) to more remote body-contact products (electronics, plastics, tires, automotive and aeronautical), hence posing potential health and environmental risks. The new field of nanosafety has emerged and needs to be explored now rather than after problems becomes so ubiquitous and difficult to treat that their trend become irreversible. Such endeavour necessitates a transdisciplinary approach. A commonly forgotten and/or misunderstood risk is that of explosion/detonation of nanopowders, due to their high specific active surface areas. Such risk is emphasized and illustrated with the present development of an appropriate risk analysis. For this particular risk, a review of characterization methods and their limitations with regard to nanopowders is presented and illustrated for a few organic and metallic nanopowders. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd."
2009-01-01,Simultaneous determination of trace Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in water using ion-pairing reversed phase chromatography - Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry,"A method was developed to simultaneously determine trace chromium species in water using ion-pairing reversed phase chromatography (RPIPC)-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). The chromatographic parameters were optimized to get the best separation, including the pH value of mobile phase, the concentrations of ion-pair reagent and methanol and the addition of EDTA in the mobile phase. The optimium mobile phase was 2.0 mmol/L tetrabutylammonium(TBA), 5% methanol(v/v), pH=5.5. Using collision cell technology to eliminate the mass interferences of 40Ar 12C+ and 35Cl16OH+ in the analysis of 52Cr+, and the detection limits of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) were 0.15 μg/L and 0.16 μg/L for 100 μL injections. The recovery range of spiked Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in water samples was 93.6%-106.2% and the RSDs were less than 4% (n =3). The results were satisfying when analyzing the chromium speciation in drinking water and rain water using this method."
2009-01-01,Effects of several nanooxides on the hatching rate of zebrafish embryos,"The ecotoxicological impacts of nanooxides (nano-ZnO, nano-TiO2, nano-Fe2O3, nano-Fe3O4 and nano-SiO2) were studied by observing the hatching rate of zebrafish embryos at 96h. Different nanooxides had different effects on hatching rate of zebrafish embryos, suggesting that the toxicity was much related to their own components. Nano-ZnO decreased the hatching rate of embryos in a concentration-dependent way and had a higher toxicity. At low concentration, the inhibition of nano-ZnO on embryo hatching was more severe than Zn2+ of the same concentration, probably due to its own special properties. The hatching rate of zebrafish embryos did not affected by nano-FeO at low conenttation, but was inhibited at high concentration. Other nanooxides, including nano-TiO2, nano-Fe3O4 and nano-SiO2, had little effect on embryo hatching."
2009-01-01,Particle size distribution of iron nanomaterials in biological medium by SR-SAXS method,"A better understanding of biological effects of nanomaterials in organisms requests knowledge of the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials in biological systems. Affected by high concentration salts and proteins in biological medium, nanoparticles are much easy to agglomerate, hence the difficulties in characterizing size distribution of the nanomaterials in biological medium. In this work, synchrotron radiation small angle X-ray scattering (SR-SAXS) was used to determine size distributions of Fe, Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 nanoparticles of various concentrations in PBS and DMEM culture medium. The results show that size distributions of the nanomaterials could perfectly analyzed by SR-SAXS. The SR-SAXS data were not affected by the particle content and types of the dispersion medium. It is concluded that SR-SAXS can be used for size measurement of nanomaterials in unstable dispersion systems."
2009-01-01,Neurotoxicity of low-dose repeatedly intranasal instillation of nano- and submicron-sized ferric oxide particles in mice,"Olfactory tract has been demonstrated to be an important portal for inhaled solid nanoparticle transportation into the central nervous system (CNS). We have previously demonstrated that intranasally instilled Fe2O 3 nanoparticles could transport into the CNS via olfactory pathway. In this study, we investigated the neurotoxicity and size effect of repeatedly low-dose (130 μg) intranasal exposure of nano- and submicron-sized Fe 2O3 particles (21 nm and 280 nm) to mice. The biomarkers of oxidative stress, activity of nitric oxide synthases and release of monoamine neurotransmitter in the brain were studied. Our results showed that significant oxidative stress was induced by the two sizes of Fe2O3 particles. The activities of GSH-Px, Cu,Zn-SOD, and cNOS significantly elevated and the total GSH and GSH/GSSG ratio significantly decreased in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus after the nano- and submicron-sized Fe2O 3 particle treatment (p < 0.05). The nano-sized Fe 2O3 generally induced greater alteration and more significant dose-effect response than the submicron-sized particle did. Some slight perturbation of monoamine neurotransmitters were found in the hippocampus after exposure to the two sizes of Fe2O3 particle. The TEM image showed that some ultrastructural alterations in nerve cells, including neurodendron degeneration, membranous structure disruption and lysosome increase in the olfactory bulb, slight dilation in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and lysosome increase in the hippocampus were induced by the nano-sized Fe2O3 treatment. In contrast, in the submicron-sized Fe2O3 treated mice, slightly swollen mitochondria and some vacuoles were observed in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus, respectively. These results indicate that intranasal exposure of Fe2O3 nanoparticles could induce more severe oxidative stress and nerve cell damage in the brain than the larger particle did. This is the first study to compare the neurotoxicity of nano- and submicron-sized Fe2O3 particles in the central nervous system after long-term and low-dose intranasal exposure. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."
2008-12-15,Potential neurological lesion after nasal instillation of TiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles in the anatase and rutile crystal phases,"Nanoscale titanium dioxide (TiO2) is massively produced and widely used in living environment, which hence make the potential risk to human health. Central nervous system (CNS) is the potential susceptible target of inhaled nanoparticles, but the studies on this aspect are limited so far. We report the accumulation and toxicity results in vivo of two crystalline phases of TiO2 nanoparticles (80 nm, rutile and 155 nm, anatase; purity >99%). The female mice were intranasally instilled with 500 μg of TiO2 nanoparticles suspension every other day for 30 days. Synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence analysis (SRXRF) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were used to determine the contents of titanium in murine brain. Then, the pathological examination of brain tissue, oxidative stress-mediated responses, and levels of neurochemicals in the brain of exposed mice were also analyzed. The obvious morphological changes of hippocampal neurons and increased GFAP-positive astrocytes in the CA4 region were observed, which were in good agreements with higher Ti contents in the hippocampus region. Oxidative stress occurred obviously in whole brain of exposed mice such as lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and increased activities of catalase, as well as the excessive release of glutamic acid and nitric oxide. These findings indicate anatase TiO2 nanoparticles exhibited higher concern on some tested biological effects. To summarize, results provided the preliminary evidence that nasal instilled TiO2 nanoparticles could be translocated into the central nervous system and cause potential lesion of brain, and the hippocampus would be the main target within brain. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2008-12-05,Time-dependent translocation and potential impairment on central nervous system by intranasally instilled TiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles,"Nanoparticles can be administered via nasal, oral, intraocular, intratracheal (pulmonary toxicity), tail vein and other routes. Here, we focus on the time-dependent translocation and potential damage of TiO2 nanoparticles on central nervous system (CNS) through intranasal instillation. Size and structural properties are important to assess biological effects of TiO2 nanoparticles. In present study, female mice were intranasally instilled with two types of well-characterized TiO2 nanoparticles (i.e. 80 nm, rutile and 155 nm, anatase; purity > 99%) every other day. Pure water instilled mice were served as controls. The brain tissues were collected and evaluated for accumulation and distribution of TiO2, histopathology, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers at post-instillation time points of 2, 10, 20 and 30 days. The titanium contents in the sub-brain regions including olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results indicated that the instilled TiO2 directly entered the brain through olfactory bulb in the whole exposure period, especially deposited in the hippocampus region. After exposure for 30 days, the pathological changes were observed in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb using Nissl staining and transmission electron microscope. The oxidative damage expressed as lipid peroxidation increased significantly, in particular in the exposed group of anatase TiO2 particles at 30 days postexposure. Exposure to anatase TiO2 particles also produced higher inflammation responses, in association with the significantly increased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL-1β) levels. We conclude that subtle differences in responses to anatase TiO2 particles versus the rutile ones could be related to crystal structure. Thus, based on these results, rutile ultrafine-TiO2 particles are expected to have a little lower risk potential for producing adverse effects on central nervous system. Although understanding the mechanisms requires further investigation, the present results suggest that we should pay attention to potential risk of occupational exposure for large-scaled production of TiO2 nanoparticles. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2008-12-01,Preparation and photocatalytic performance of titania nanotubes loaded with Ag nanoparticles,"Titania nanotubes (TNTs) were synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of rutile-phase TiO2 nanoparticles in 10 mol· L-1 NaOH solution at 110 °C for 24 h. The Ag loaded titania nanotubes (Ag/TNTs) were obtained by chemical deposition method with the TNTs suspending in the AgNO3 solution (pH=8) at 50 °C. The characterizations of the as-synthesized samples were performed by TEM, EDS, XRD, XPS, and UV-Vis spectra. The photocatalytic performance of the Ag/TNTs was investigated by UV-light induced photocatalytic decomposition of methyl orange(MO). The results showed that the inner/outer diameters of TNTs were about 6/10 nm and the length was several hundred nanometers. Both the shape and the crystalline of the nanotubes were not changed after the modification. The zero oxidation state Ag quantum dots, about 4 nm in diameter, were well dispersed on the external surface of the nanotubes. Ag/TNTs exhibited enhanced absorption at the visible range in the UV-Vis spectra. The Ag nanoparticles were found to significantly enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanotubes, and the catalyst system was demonstrated to be highly efficient for the UV-light induced photocatalytic decomposition of MO compared to both rutile-phase TiO2 nanoparticles and pure TNTs. After irradiation for 60 min, the decomposition rates of MO solution in rutile-phase TiO2 nanoparticles, TNTs, and Ag/TNTs system were 46.8%, 57.2%, and 92.2%, respectively. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica."
2008-12-01,Biological effect of intranasally instilled titanium dioxide nanoparticles on female mice,"The toxicological effect of TiO2 nanoparticles with different crystal structure (80 nm for rutile and 155 nm for anatase) on female mice was investigated through intranasal instillation. After exposure for 30 days at the dose of 50 mg/kg body weight, no abnormal activity and mortality were observed with the normally increasing body weight of mice. The coefficients of tissues to body weight also show no obvious difference from the control except the increased coefficient of kidneys in mice exposed to 80 nm TiO2 nanoparticles. Titanium contents and histopathology examination indicate the no pathological response in the lung was induced by the increased TiO2 deposition, and the liver, heart, and spleen were not influenced. The severe pathology changes in kidneys suggest that TiO2 nanoparticles may be excreted out by kidneys via system circulation. However, the serum biochemical parameters were not changed compared with the control, which means no obvious functional impairment induced by the nasal exposure for 30 days. In addition, the higher titanium contents in the brain tissues imply that the translocation and deposition of nanoparticles through intranasal instilling pathway is different from the other routes such as intratracheal inhalation or intratracheal instillation. The influence of deposited nanoparticles on central nervous system needs further investigation and is underway. © World Scientific Publishing Company."
2008-12-01,Trace metal disturbance in mice brain after intranasal exposure of nano- and submicron-sized Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> particles,"Trace metals in the brain play an important role in the function of central nervous system (CNS). The objective of this work is to investigate the effects of intranasal exposure of nano- and submicron-sized Fe2O3 particles on the homeostasis of trace metals in the brain. After a single intranasal instillation of nano- and submicron-sized Fe2O3 particles, the con-tents of Fe, Cu and Zn in the sub-brain regions were determined in the time course from 4 h till to the 30 day post-exposure. Our results indicated that the imbalance of trace metals in the sub-brain regions of mice was induced by the two sizes of Fe2O3 particles. The more significant accumulation of Fe in the brain was found in the nano-Fe 2O3 treated mice than in the submicron-Fe 2O3 treated ones: meanwhile, similar alterations of Zn contents in the brain were observed as well. A strong positive correlation between Fe and Zn levels in the olfactory bulb of nano-Fe2O 3 instilled mice and in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of submicron-Fe2O3 instilled mice were found. This is the first trial to investigate the disturbance of trace metals in the brain after exposure to Fe2O3 nanoparticles. These results state that much attention should be paid to the potential impact of inhaled Fe 2O3 nanoparticles on the CNS."
2008-12-01,Biopharmaceutics and therapeutic potential of engineered nanomaterials,"Engineered nanomaterials are at the leading edge of the rapidly developing nanosciences and are founding an important class of new materials with specific physicochemical properties different from bulk materials with the same compositions. The potential for nanomaterials is rapidly expanding with novel applications constantly being explored in different areas. The unique size-dependent properties of nanomaterials make them very attractive for pharmaceutical applications. Investigations of physical, chemical and biological properties of engineered nanomaterials have yielded valuable information. Cytotoxic effects of certain engineered nanomaterials towards malignant cells form the basis for one aspect of nanomedicine. It is inferred that size, three dimensional shape, hydrophobicity and electronic configurations make them an appealing subject in medicinal chemistry. Their unique structure coupled with immense scope for derivatization forms a base for exciting developments in therapeutics. This review article addresses the fate of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of engineered nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo. It updates the distinctive methodology used for studying the biopharmaceutics of nanoparticles. This review addresses the future potential and safety concerns and genotoxicity of nanoparticle formulations in general. It particularly emphasizes the effects of nanoparticles on metabolic enzymes as well as the parenteral or inhalation administration routes of nanoparticle formulations. This paper illustrates the potential of nanomedicine by discussing biopharmaceutics of fullerene derivatives and their suitability for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Future direction is discussed as well. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd."
2008-12-01,Age-related differences in pulmonary and cardiovascular responses to SiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticle inhalation: Nanotoxicity has susceptible population,"Epidemiologic studies have revealed that pollution by ambient particulates is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, particularly in older people. Toxicologic sensitivity of nanoparticles in different ages was investigated for the first time to demonstrate and explain an age-related difference in response to manufactured nanoparticles. Young, adult, and old rats physiologically inhaled air containing aerosol of manufactured SiO2 nanoparticles (24.1 mg/m3; 40 min/day) for four weeks. Changes in serum biomarkers, hemorheologic, pulmonary inflammation, heart injury, and pathology in rats of different ages and their corresponding controls were compared. Inhalation of SiO2 nanoparticles under identical conditions caused pulmonary and cardiovascular alterations in old rats, yet less change in young and adult rats, including pulmonary inflammation, myocardial ischemic damage, atrio-ventricular blockage, and increase in fibrinogen concentration and blood viscosity. Old individuals were more sensitive to nanoparticle exposure than the young and adult rats. The risk of causing pulmonary damages was: old > young > adult The risk of cardiovascular disorder was observed only in old age. Our results suggest that different ages may require different biomarkers for identifying pulmonary toxicity during inhalation of nanoparticles. © 2008 American Chemical Society."

2008-10-01,Inhibition of tumor growth by endohedral metallofullerenol nanoparticles optimized as reactive oxygen species scavenger,"Intraperitoneal injection of [Gd@C82(OH)22] n nanoparticles decreased activities of enzymes associated with the metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tumor-bearing mice. Several physiologically relevant ROS were directly scavenged by nanoparticles, and lipid peroxidation was inhibited in this study. [Gd@C82(OH) 22]n nanoparticles significantly reduced the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal of the stable 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl radical measured by ESR spectroscopy. Likewise, studies using ESR with spin-trapping demonstrated efficient scavenging of superoxide radical anion, hydroxyl radical, and singlet oxygen (1O2) by [Gd@C82(OH) 22]n nanoparticles. In vitro studies using liposomes prepared from bovine liver phosphatidylcholine revealed that nanoparticles also had a strong inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation. Consistent with their ability to scavenge ROS and inhibit lipid peroxidation, we determined that [Gd@C82(OH)22]n nanoparticles also protected cells subjected in vitro to oxidative stress. Studies using human lung adenocarcinoma cells or rat brain capillary endothelial cells demonstrated that [Gd@C82(OH)22]n nanoparticles reduced H 2O2-induced ROS formation and mitochondrial damage. [Gd@C82(OH)22]n nanoparticles efficiently inhibited the growth of malignant tumors in vivo. In summary, the results obtained in this study reveal antitumor activities of [Gd@C82(OH) 22]n nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo. Because ROS are known to be implicated in the etiology of a wide range of human diseases, including cancer, the present findings demonstrate that the potent inhibition of [Gd@C82(OH)22]n nanoparticles on tumor growth likely relates with typical capacity of scavenging reactive oxygen species.

2008-10-01,Eliminating active species by endohedral metallofullerenol in vitro and in vivo,"We previously demonstrated that gadolinium endohedral metallofullerenol Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles had high inhibitory activity on growth of malignant tumor in vivo by uncertain mechanism(s). The activities of enzymes associated with the metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were decreased in the tumor-bearing mice by intraperitoneally injection of Gd@C 82(OH)22 nanoparticles. In current study, systemic investigation of the potential function of Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles found that it expressed direct scavenging activity toward active species. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, the state-of-art technique to measure chemical active species that have one or more unpaired electrons in parallel, was employed to measure free radicals scavenging activities of Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles in vitro. Pre-treatment with Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles significantly reduced ESR signal of various of reactive oxygen species. In addition, Gd@C 82(OH)22 nanoparticles demonstrated extensively scavenging activities of active species measured in vivo, which was consistent with reduced progression of cancer cells treated with Gd@C82(OH) 22 nanoparticles. In summary, results obtained in this study revealed strong active species-scavenging activities of Gd@C82(OH) 22 nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo. Scavenging activities of hydroxylated Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles was systemically measured in different milieu, and demonstrated the inhibition of tumor progression by treatment with Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticles likely due to eliminating active species."
2008-10-01,Long-term accumulation and low toxicity of single-walled carbon nanotubes in intravenously exposed mice,"The biomedical application of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), such as drug delivery and cancer treatment, requires a clear understanding of their fate and toxicological profile after intravenous administration. In this study, the long-term accumulation and toxicity of intravenously injected SWCNTs in the main organs (such as liver, lung and spleen) in mice were carefully studied. Although SWCNTs stayed in mice over 3 months, they showed low toxicity to mice. The long-term accumulation of SWCNTs in the main organs was evidenced by using Raman spectroscopy and TEM technique. Statistically significant changes in organ indices and serum biochemical parameters (LDH, ALT and AST) were observed. The histological observations demonstrate that slight inflammation and inflammatory cell infiltration occurred in lung, but the serum immunological indicators (CH 50 level and TNF-α level) remained unchanged. No apoptosis was induced in the main organs. The decreasing glutathione (GSH) level and increasing malondialdehyde (MDA) level suggest that the toxicity of SWCNTs might be due to the oxidative stress. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2008-09-01,Recent progress on the pro and cons of biological effects of nanomaterials,"With the rapid developing of nanotechnology, the use of nanomaterials in medical imaging, disease diagnoses, drug delivery, cancer treatment, gene therapy, and basic research have also progressed quickly. The beneficial uses of nanomaterials may cause human exposure through inhalation, ingestion, skin uptake, and intravenous injection. When nanomaterials interact with biological systems, they may generate adverse biological effects. The possible toxic effects of these nanomaterials are unknown until now. The positive applications in biomedicine as well as the negative biological effects of nanomaterials on cardiovascular, respiratory and other systems are highlighted, the possible mechanisms by which nanoparticles result in cardiovascular and pulmonary morbidity are also discussed, and the possible interaction routes and sequences is farther reviewed. Finally, the perspective of risk assessment of nanomaterials in the nature is summarized."
2008-09-01,SIRT1 contributes in part to cisplatin resistance in cancer cells by altering mitochondrial metabolism,"Tumors frequently develop resistance to cisplatin, a platinum drug used as a cornerstone of present-day chemotherapy regimens, significantly decreasing its usefulness in the clinic. Although it is known that cisplatin-resistant (CP-r) cancer cells commonly grow more slowly and exhibit reduced uptake of various compounds, including nutrients,the effect of tumor metabolism on cisplatin resistance is unclear. It was found that in CP-r cells, uptake of 2-deoxyglucose was reduced due to dysfunction and altered morphology of mitochondria compared with cisplatin-sensitive parental cancer cells. The CP-r cells overexpressed SIRT1, a histone deacetylase that plays a central role in DNA damage response and transcriptional silencing. Incubation of drug-sensitive cells in low glucose medium induced the expression of SIRT1 and increased cellular resistance to cisplatin. Reduced SIRT1 expression by a SIRT1 SMART small interfering RNA duplex sensitized the >20-fold resistant CP-r cells to cisplatin treatment 1.5- to 2-fold, and SIRT1 overexpression by SIRT1 cDNA transfection increased cisplatin resistance in cisplatin-sensitive cells by 2- to 3-fold. Our findings therefore suggest that reduced glucose use and altered mitochondrial metabolism mediated by SIRT1 is one of several alterations that contribute to cellular resistance to cisplatin.

2008-08-21,Comparative study of carbon and BN nanographenes: Ground electronic states and energy gap engineering,"The relationship between stabilities and shape configurations of carbon and boron nitride (BN) nanographenes (NGs) was studied at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of rectangular-shaped carbon nanographenes (CNGs) decrease as the graphene sizes increase with a direct inverse dependence on the length of zigzag edge. Due to the double zigzag edge boundaries, the CNGs with long zigzag edges have open-shell singlet ground states; in contrast, the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of BN nanographenes (BNNGs) have a weak dependence with size; all BNNGs have closed-shell singlet ground states, and those with long zigzag edges have slightly larger energy gaps. CNGs with long zigzag edges are less favorable energetically than their structural isomers with long armchair edges, while the BNNGs have the opposite preference. Chemical modifications that change the long zigzag edge into armchair type can efficiently stabilize the kinetically unstable CNGs (with open-shell singlet ground states) and modify their energy gaps. © 2008 American Chemical Society."
2008-08-07,Energetics of endohedral atoms in type-I clathrates observed by soft x-ray spectroscopy,"We present an extensive soft x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study on the core levels of the endohedral atoms of Ba8 Ga16 Ge30 (BGG), Sr8 Ga16 Ge30 (SGG), Eu8 Ga16 Ge30 (EGG), and Sr8 Ga16 Si30 (SGS) single crystals, performed at a high-energy facility. Unexpected features evidencing the different shift for the 2a and 6d sites between Ba4d and Sr3d are observed for BGG and SGG. The detailed analyses including theoretical support by first-principles band-structure calculations lead to the surprising conclusion that the component distributions of the larger tetrakaidecahedral cage are different depending on the endohedral atoms, which is in contrast to the past consensus that BGG and SGG have the same framework structure. The differences are further supported by analysis of the Ga3d core levels. This may suggest thorough reconsiderations on earlier interpretations of experimental data. © 2008 The American Physical Society."
2008-08-04,"Mapping technique for biodistribution of elements in a model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans, after exposure to copper nanoparticles with microbeam synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence","To investigate the toxicological effects of nanomaterials, experimental studies on the absorption and accumulation in organisms are of broad interest. In the present study, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) was used as a ""model"" organism to investigate the bioaccumulation and toxicological effects of engineered copper nanoparticles with a scanning technique of microbeam synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (μ-SRXRF). The adult hermaphrodite is anatomically simple with 959 somatic cells and 1 mm in length. The mapping results of the whole organism indicate that the exposure to copper nanoparticles can result in an obvious elevation of Cu and K levels, and a change of bio-distribution of Cu in nematodes. Accumulation of Cu occurs in the head and at a location 1/3 of the way up the body from the tail compared to the un-exposed control. In contrast, a higher amount of Cu was detected in other portion of worm body, especially in its excretory cells and intestine when exposed to Cu2+. The results compared well with total Cu levels in nematodes, which were 4.10 ± 0.54, 12.32 ± 0.49 and 5.22 ± 0.63 μg g-1 dry weight for the PBS, Cu2+ and Cu nanoparticle groups, respectively, measured by ICP-MS. The nondestructive and multi-elemental μ-SRXRF provides an important tool for mapping the elemental distribution in the whole body of a single tiny nematode at lower levels. © 2008 The Royal Society of Chemistry."
2008-08-01,Bio-distribution and metabolic paths of silica coated CdSeS quantum dots,"With the rapid development of quantum dot (QD) technology, water-soluble QDs have the prospect of being used as a biological probe for specific diagnoses, but their biological behaviors in vivo are little known. Our recent in vivo studies concentrated on the bio-kinetics of QDs coated by hydroxyl group modified silica networks (the QDs are 21.3 ± 2.0 nm in diameter and have maximal emission at 570 nm). Male ICR mice were intravenously given the water-soluble QDs with a single dose of 5 nmol/mouse. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry was used to measure the 111Cd content to indicate the concentration of QDs in plasma, organs, and excretion samples collected at predetermined time intervals. Meanwhile, the distribution and aggregation state of QDs in tissues were also investigated by pathological examination and differential centrifugation. The plasma half-life and clearance of QDs were 19.8 ± 3.2 h and 57.3 ± 9.2 ml/h/kg, respectively. The liver and kidney were the main target organs for QDs. The QDs metabolized in three paths depending on their distinct aggregated states in vivo. A fraction of free QDs, maintaining their original form, could be filtered by glomerular capillaries and excreted via urine as small molecules within five days. Most QDs bound to protein and aggregated into larger particles that were metabolized in the liver and excreted via feces in vivo. After five days, 8.6% of the injected dose of aggregated QDs still remained in hepatic tissue and it was difficult for this fraction to clear. © 2008."
2008-07-23,Detection of trace Hg<sup>2+</sup> via induced circular dichroism of DNA wrapped around single-walled carbon nanotubes,"The strongly induced circular dichroism (ICD) signals of DNA wrapped around single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are shown by the Synchrotron Radiation Facility. In solution, trace amounts of Hg ions have a strong affinity to bind the nucleic bases of DNA-SWCNTs via a pseudo-first-order kinetic reaction. The Hg binding to the bases of DNA results in partial DNA disassociation from the SWCNTs. Such disassociation of DNA from the SWCNTs will decrease the coupling effects of the transition dipole moments between DNA and SWCNTs, thus inducing the ICD signal of DNA-SWCNTs to decrease significantly. Herein, the ICD of DNA-SWCNTs is applied to detect the concentration of Hg ions at nM level. Copyright © 2008 American Chemical Society."

2008-05-21,Comparative study of pulmonary responses to nano- and submicron-sized ferric oxide in rats,"Ferric oxide (Fe2O3) nanoparticles are of considerable interest for application in nanotechnology related fields. However, as iron being a highly redox-active transition metal, the safety of iron nanomaterials need to be further studied. In this study, the size, dose and time dependent of Fe2O3 nanoparticle on pulmonary and coagulation system have been studied after intratracheal instillation. The Fe2O3 nanoparticles with mean diameters of 22 and 280 nm, respectively, were intratracheally instilled to male Sprague Dawley rats at low (0.8 mg/kg bw) and high (20 mg/kg bw) doses. The toxic effects were monitored in the post-instilled 1, 7 and 30 days. Our results showed that the Fe2O3 nanoparticle exposure could induce oxidative stress in lung. Alveolar macrophage (AM) over-loading of phagocytosed nanoparticle by high dose treatment had occurred, while the non-phagocytosed particles were found entering into alveolar epithelial in day 1 after exposure. Several inflammatory reactions including inflammatory and immune cells increase, clinical pathological changes: follicular hyperplasia, protein effusion, pulmonary capillary vessel hyperaemia and alveolar lipoproteinosis in lung were observed. The sustain burden of particles in AM and epithelium cells has caused lung emphysema and pro-sign of lung fibrosis. At the post-instilled day 30, the typical coagulation parameters, prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) in blood of low dose 22 nm-Fe2O3 treated rats were significantly longer than the controls. We concluded that both of the two-sized Fe2O3 particle intratracheal exposure could induce lung injury. Comparing with the submicron-sized Fe2O3 particle, the nano-sized Fe2O3 particle may increase microvascular permeability and cell lysis in lung epitheliums and disturb blood coagulation parameters significantly. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The presence of stacking defects has been found to be dominating the branching points in these complex nanostructures. The synergistic effects of the dipolar force and stacking defects in the anisotropic self-assembly process are essential for producing complex nanostructures with multiple generations of branches. The inorganic Au dendrimers may have significant applications in diverse areas including as potent catalysts without a supporting scaffold, templates for the synthesis of other nanomaterials, and potential carriers for specific molecules. The method is also applicable to the fabrication of other noble-metal dendrimers via the stacking-defect-modulated anisotropic self-assembly of nanoparticles."

2008-04-09,The translocation of fullerenic nanoparticles into lysosome via the pathway of clathrin-mediated endocytosis,"Manufactured fullerene nanoparticles easily enter into cells and hence have been rapidly developed for biomedical uses. However, it is generally unknown which route the nanoparticles undergo when crossing cell membranes and where they localize to the intracellular compartments. Herein we have used both microscopic imaging and biological techniques to explore the processes of [C60(C(COOH)2)2]n nanoparticles across cellular membranes and their intracellular translocation in 3T3 L1 and RH-35 living cells. The fullerene nanoparticles are quickly internalized by the cells and then routed to the cytoplasm with punctate localization. Upon entering the cell, they are synchronized to lysosome-like vesicles. The [C 60(C(COOH)2)2]n nanoparticles entering cells are mainly via endocytosis with time-, temperature- and energy-dependent manners. The cellular uptake of [C60(C(COOH) 2)2]n nanoparticles was found to be clathrin-mediated but not caveolae-mediated endocytosis. The endocytosis mechanism and the subcellular target location provide key information for the better understanding and predicting of the biomedical function of fullerene nanoparticles inside cells. © IOP Publishing Ltd."

Least-squares fitting of the X-ray absorption near-edge spectra found that inorganic mercury is the major mercury species in hair samples (91.74%), while inorganic and methyl mercury are both about 50% of total mercury in RBC and serum samples, which is in agreement with the data obtained by acidic extraction, fractionation of Hg2+ and CH3Hg+ and quantification by ICP-MS. Curve-fitting analysis revealed that the Hg-S bond length and coordination number in hair were 0.248 ± 0.002 nm and 3.10, respectively, while the S-Hg bond length and coordination number in hair were 0.236 ± 0.002 nm and 4.05. The Hg-S bond length and coordination number in RBC were 0.251 ± 0.003 nm and 4.09, respectively, while they were 0.228 ± 0.002 nm and 4.08 in serum, respectively.

2008-02-01,Acute toxicological impact of nano- and submicro-scaled zinc oxide powder on healthy adult mice,"In this work, the acute oral toxicity of 20- and 120-nm ZnO powder at doses of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-g/kg body weight was evaluated referred to the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals. As the results, both 20- and 120-nm ZnO belong to non-toxic chemicals according to the Globally Harmonized Classification System (GHS) for the classification of chemicals. The distribution determination showed that Zn was mainly retained in the bone, kidney and pancreas after 20- and 120-nm ZnO administration. However, the results of blood measurement suggest that the increase in blood viscosity could be induced by low and median dose of 20-nm ZnO but high dose of 120-nm ZnO. The pathological examination showed that the 120-nm ZnO treated mice had dose-effect pathological damages in stomach, liver, heart and spleen, whereas, 20-nm ZnO displayed negative dose-effect damages in liver, spleen and pancreas. Therefore, we conclude that the liver, spleen, heart, pancreas and bone are the target organs for 20- and 120-nm ZnO oral exposure. More attention should be paid on the potential toxicity induced by low dose of 20-nm ZnO oral exposure. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."
2008-02-01,Possibilities for global governance of converging technologies,"The convergence of nanotechnology, modern biology, the digital revolution and cognitive sciences will bring about tremendous improvements in transformative tools, generate new products and services, enable opportunities to meet and enhance human potential and social achievements, and in time reshape societal relationships. This paper focuses on the progress made in governance of such converging, emerging technologies and suggests possibilities for a global approach. Specifically, this paper suggests creating a multidisciplinary forum or a consultative coordinating group with members from various countries to address globally governance of converging, emerging technologies. The proposed framework for governance of converging technologies calls for four key functions: supporting the transformative impact of the new technologies; advancing responsible development that includes health, safety and ethical concerns; encouraging national and global partnerships; and establishing commitments to long-term planning and investments centered on human development. Principles of good governance guiding these functions include participation of all those who are forging or affected by the new technologies, transparency of governance strategies, responsibility of each participating stakeholder, and effective strategic planning. Introduction and management of converging technologies must be done with respect for immediate concerns, such as privacy, access to medical advancements, and potential human health effects. At the same time, introduction and management should also be done with respect for longer-term concerns, such as preserving human integrity, dignity and welfare. The suggested governance functions apply to four levels of governance: (a) adapting existing regulations and organizations; (b) establishing new programs, regulations and organizations specifically to handle converging technologies; (c) building capacity for addressing these issues into national policies and institutions; and (d) making international agreements and partnerships. Several possibilities for improving the governance of converging technologies in the global self-regulating ecosystem are recommended: using open-source and incentive-based models, establishing corresponding science and engineering platforms, empowering the stakeholders and promoting partnerships among them, implementing long-term planning that includes international perspectives, and institute voluntary and science-based measures for risk management. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."
2008-01-24,Isomeric and structural impacts on electron acceptability of carbon cages in atom-bridged fullerene dimers,"The electrochemical properties of the carbon-bridged fullerene dimers C121(I), C121(II), C121(III), C131, and C141 were characterized systematically for the first time in this study. Cyclic voltammogram and differential pulse voltammogram analyses revealed that they first underwent three reversible fullerene-unit-based reduction processes where each of the two carbon cages accepted one electron in each step and then possessed a different deep reduction sequence from the fourth to sixth reduction potentials of the fullerene cages. The electronic interactions between cages in the atom-bridged dimers (e.g., C 60-C-C60) were found to be different from those of dimers in which two cages were connected directly. Comparison studies of the redox properties of the five dimers revealed that the C60 dimerization via [5.6]-[6.6] connection influenced the cage electron acceptability much more than that of [5.6]-[5.6] or [6.6]-[6.6] connections and the dimerization with C 70 cages influenced the reduction potentials of dimerized products more potently than that with C60 cages. Further results from controlled potential electrolysis, high-performance liquid chromatography, matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, ultraviolet absorption spectral analyses demonstrated the reduction processes and a dissociation of the dimers based on reductions. The theoretical understanding of the experiments was investigated by using time-dependent density functional calculations for the ionic states of C 121(I, II, III)n- with n = 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. © 2008 American Chemical Society."

Molar ratios of the proteins were calculated by the analytical results and the known sulfur content in proteins. The mobile phase was 0. 1 mol/L Tris-HAc. In order to avoid the polyatomic interferences on the sulfur determination, oxygen was added into the collision cell and reacted with sulfur to form sulfur-oxide ion. Therefore, the intensity of 32S 16O+ represented sulfur content during the measurement. These results were in good agreement with the gravimetric results. The RSDs for the proteins are less than 3% and the detection limits for BSA, SOD and MT-II are 14, 52 and 27 pmol, respectively."
2008-01-01,Rapid translocation and pharmacokinetics of hydroxylated single-walled carbon nanotubes in mice,"Determining the in vivo pharmacological profiles of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is essential for the promising biomedical applications of CNTs, such as drug delivery. Using iodine-131 tracing we studied the fundamental behavior of hydroxylated single-walled CNTs (SWNTols) shortly after they were introduced into the animal body (from 2 min to 1 h) by providing the biodistribution data and pharmacokinetic parameters. The distribution was slightly influenced by injection modes, but in any mode radioactivity was found all over the body within 2 min except brain. Liver, kidneys, stomach and lungs are the target organs with high uptake of SWNTols. The SWNTols content in several tissues, such as heart, lungs, and muscle is positively correlated with its content in the blood, showing clearly that the blood stream brings SWNTols to the whole body. This work presents the initial in vivo behavior of the water-soluble functionalized SWNTs, providing also the basic data to show opportunities and limitations for realization of the CNT-based drug vehicle. © 2008, Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

2008-01-01,Study of Selenium Speciation in Selenized Rice Using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer,"On the basis of Osborne fractionation, albumin, globulin, protamine and glutelin in selenium (Se)-rich rice were extracted with water, 2% NaCl solution, 70% alcohol and 0.5% alkaline solution subsequently. The content of Se in these protein extracts was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). The chemical forms of Se in albumin extract and enzymatic digests of rice were analyzed with a hyphenated technique of high-performance liquid chromatography and ICP-MS. The Se content in four types of extracts shows an order of glutelin > protamine > albumin > globulin. The protein with molecular weight of 12.6 kDa is the primary Se-containing protein in extracts of albumin, and selenocysteine is the predominant selenoamino acid in the enzymatic digests of rice. © 2008 Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences."
2007-12-10,Ultrahigh reactivity provokes nanotoxicity: Explanation of oral toxicity of nano-copper particles,"Recently, studies on the biological effects of nanomaterials show signs that some of the manufactured nanoparticles exhibit unexpected toxicity to living organisms. It has previously been reported that the copper particles possess size-depended toxicity. In this paper, we propose that the ultrahigh chemical reactivity of nano-copper results in the specific nanotoxicity which is fully proved by in vitro and in vivo experiment. Using chemical kinetics study (in vitro) and blood gas and plasma electrolytes analysis (in vivo), we found that high reactivity cause the big toxicological difference between small size (23.5 nm) and big size (17 μm). The result is also consistent with biochemistry assay, pathological examination and copper content measurement in renal tissue in vivo. For chemical reactive nanoparticles, metallic nano-copper for instance, both the particles themselves and the resulting product (copper ion) should be fully explored. The nano-copper particles may not compromise the mice directly, however, they lead to the accumulation of excessive alkalescent substance and heavy metal ions (copper ions) culminating the metabolic alkalosis and copper ion overload. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2007-10-18,Switchable semiconductive property of the polyhydroxylated metallofullerene,"The temperature-sensitive property of polyhydroxylated metallofullerene film of Gd@C82(OH)x with special hydroxyl number was studied using synchrotron radiation ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and TEM techniques. From room temperature (RT) to 4 °C the photoelectron onset energy of the spectra of Gd@C82(OH)12 shifted from 1.9 to 0.2 eV, indicating that Gd@C82(OH)12 automatically shifted from insulator at RT to semiconductor at 4 °C. However, this could not be observed for Gd@C82(OH)20. TEM experiments show that the variation of conductivity can be ascribed to formation of a microcrystal under low temperature. The dipole moment induced unique intermolecular interactions and self-assembled microcrystalline structures for Gd@C82(OH12. This may cause reconstruction of the upper valence band formed by π-like electrons as well as the density of states (DOS) around the Fermi level (EF) and reconstruct the deeper valence band formed by σ-like electrons, eventually resulting in a shift to a semiconducting nature. These findings revealed a novel nature for polyhydroxylated Gd@C82(OH)x materials: Their insulating properties can be controllably tuned into semiconducting ones as a function of temperature. © 2007 American Chemical Society."

Some recent data support the concept that the central nervous system (CNS) may be a target for the inhaled fine particulates. This work describes initial observation of the transport of intranasally instilled fine ferric oxide (Fe2O3) particles in animal brain. The iron micro-distribution and chemical state in the mice olfactory bulb and brain stem on day 14 after intranasal instillation of fine Fe2O3 particle (280±80 nm) suspension at a single dose of 40 mg/kg body weight were analyzed by synchrotron radiation x-ray fluorescence and x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). The micro-distribution map of iron in the olfactory bulb and brain stem shows an obvious increase of Fe contents in the olfactory nerve and the trigeminus of brain stem, suggesting that Fe2O3 particles were possibly transported via uptake by sensory nerve endings of the olfactory nerve and trigeminus. The XANES results indicate that the ratios of Fe (III)/Fe (II) were increased in the olfactory bulb and brain stem. The further histopathological observation showed that the neuron fatty degeneration occurred in the CA3 area of hippocampus. Such results imply an adverse impact of inhalation of fine Fe2O3 particles on CNS. © Humana Press Inc. 2007."

2007-08-01,Social and ethical interactions with nano: Mapping the early literature,"There is a rapidly expanding field of research on social and ethical interactions with nano-scaled sciences and technologies. An important question is: What does social and ethical research actually mean when it is focussed on technological applications that are largely hypothetical, and a field of science spread out across multiple disciplines and lacking unification? This paper maps early literature in the field of research as a way of answering this question. Our aim is to describe how this field is developing in response to its difficult task, and particularly, to comment on the topics of focus and where there is potential for future development. We present four topical categories, labelled Governance, Perception, Science and Philosophy, and use these as a tool to both map the field and to analyse its development. We find a majority of literature currently focused on issues of governance and perception, and offer suggestions for why this might be so. We then discuss cross-category themes of definition, novelty and interdisciplinarity, highlighting diverse positions and a problematic lack of direct debate. Our conclusion is that the field would benefit from more interaction, cross-referencing and creative research across traditional fields of inquiry. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007."
2007-06-14,"Photochemical and photophysical properties of three carbon-bridged fullerene dimers: C<inf>121</inf> (I, II, III)","The photochemical and photophysical properties of the three C121 isomers (I, II, III) were investigated with MADLI-TOF-MS, UV-vis spectra, fluorescence spectra, absorption spectra of their DMA complexes, and theoretical calculations. The three isomers of C121 (I, II, III) have different stabilities under laser irradiation, but isomer I and isomer II show good stability against the heat-induced conversion between different isomers: No conversion between the isomers was found after heating the mixture of isomer I and isomer II at 353 K for 12 h in Ar atmosphere. The results of UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra indicate that interactions between two C60 moieties of C60=C=C60 in the ground and singlet states are not significant, C121 (I, II, III) behaves as an electron-acceptor similar to C60. These indicate that the formation of the fullerene chain structure (e.g., C60=C=C60) does not disturb the photochemical and photophysical properties of the C60 monomer itself, even that the properties were enhanced by the formation of the polymer. This is significant for the C60 polymer in photochemical or photoelectronic applications in which C60=C=C60 can be an excellent basic unit of polymers. © 2007 American Chemical Society."
2007-03-01,The way of stabilizing non-IPR fullerenes and structural elucidation of C<inf>54</inf>Cl<inf>8</inf>,"Recently, a new non-IPR chlorofullerene C54C18 was isolated experimentally (Science 2004, 304, 699). To explore the ways to stabilize non-IPR fullerenes, the authors studied all of the possible isomers of C54 fullerene and some of the C54Cl8 isomers at PM3, B3LYP/3-21G, and B3LYP/6-31G* levels. Combined with analysis of pentagon distributions, bond resonance energies, and steric strains, C 54:540 with the least number of 5/5 bonds was determined to be the thermodynamically best isomer for the C54Cl8. Based on C54:540, the most probable structure of the experimental C 54Cl8 was elucidated. The results suggested one of the necessary conditions of stabilizing non-IPR fullerenes: chemical derivatizations of either endohedral complexation or exohedral addition need to sufficiently stabilize all of the kinetically unstable 5/5 bonds of the cages. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
2007-01-30,Acute toxicity and biodistribution of different sized titanium dioxide particles in mice after oral administration,"In order to evaluate the toxicity of TiO2 particles, the acute toxicity of nano-sized TiO2 particles (25 and 80 nm) on adult mice was investigated compared with fine TiO2 particles (155 nm). Due to the low toxicity, a fixed large dose of 5 g/kg body weight of TiO2 suspensions was administrated by a single oral gavage according to the OECD procedure. In 2 weeks, TiO2 particles showed no obvious acute toxicity. However, the female mice showed high coefficients of liver in the nano-sized (25 and 80 nm) groups. The changes of serum biochemical parameters (ALT/AST, LDH) and pathology (hydropic degeneration around the central vein and the spotty necrosis of hepatocytes) of liver indicated that the hepatic injury was induced after exposure to mass different-sized TiO2 particles. In addition, the nephrotoxicity like increased BUN level and pathology change of kidneys was also observed in the experimental groups. The significant change of serum LDH and alpha-HBDH in 25 and 80 nm groups showed the myocardial damage compared with the control group. However, there are no abnormal pathology changes in the heart, lung, testicle (ovary), and spleen tissues. Biodistribution experiment showed that TiO2 mainly retained in the liver, spleen, kidneys, and lung tissues, which indicated that TiO2 particles could be transported to other tissues and organs after uptake by gastrointestinal tract. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2007-01-30,Investigation of mercury-containing proteins by enriched stable isotopic tracer and size-exclusion chromatography hyphenated to inductively coupled plasma-isotope dilution mass spectrometry,"In order to investigate trace mercury-containing proteins in maternal rat and their offspring, a method of enriched stable isotopic tracer (196Hg and 198Hg) combined with size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled to inductively coupled plasma-isotope dilution mass spectrometry (ICP-IDMS) was developed. Prior to the analysis, 196Hg- and 198Hg-enriched methylmercury was administrated to the pregnant rats. Then the mercury-containing proteins in serum and brain cytosol of the dam and pup rats were separated by size-exclusion columns and the mercury was detected by ICP-MS. The ICP-MS spectrogram of the tracing samples showed significantly elevated 196Hg and 198Hg isotopic signals compared with the natural ones, indicating that the detection sensitivity could be increased by the tracer method. The contents of mercury in chromatographic fractions of the dam and pup rat brain cytosol were quantitatively estimated by post-column reverse ID-ICP-MS. The quantitative speciation differences of mercury in brain cytosol between the dam and pup rats were observed, indicating that such studies could be useful for toxicological estimation. Additionally, the isotopic ratio measurement of 198Hg/202Hg in the tracing samples could be used to identify the artifact mercury species caused in the analytical procedure. The study demonstrates that the tracer method combined with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ICP-IDMS could provide reliably qualitative and quantitative information on mercury-containing proteins in organisms. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

2007-01-01,Influence of intranasal instilled titanium dioxide nanoparticles on monoaminergic neurotransmitters of female mice at different exposure time,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of intranasal instilling titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles on monoaminergic neurotransmitters at different-time exposure. METHODS: CD female mice were intranasally instilled three different-sized (25 nm, 80 nm and 155 nm) TiO, suspension every other day in a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight. The control group was instilled the same volume of Milli-Q water. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to analyze the titanium contents in murine brain after exposure to TiO2 particles 2 days, 10 days, 20 days and 30 days. The monoaminergic neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA), 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and homovanillic (HVA), were determined by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with electrochemical detector. RESULTS: After exposure to TiO, nanoparticles 10 days, the titanium contents in murine brain were increased, the titanium content in the 25 nm group was up to (1059.3 +/- 293.5) ng/g. In 20 days, the titanium content decreased slowly with the metabolism of titanium in vivo, but it kept at a high level, the content decreased to (654.7 +/- 269.2) ng/g in the 25 nm group. After exposure to TiO2 nanoparticles 30 days, the titanium contents had no obviously change. Because of the accumulation of TiO, in the brain, the contents of NE and 5-HT increased significantly after exposure to 80 nm and 155 nm TiO, nanoparticles 20 days, while the decreased contents of DA, DOPAC, HVA and 5-HIAA were observed. CONCLUSION: The inhaled TiO2 nanoparticles could be translocated to and deposited in murine brain after absorbing by nasal mucosa, and further influence the releases and metabolisms of monoaminergic neurotransmitters in brain."
2007-01-01,Determination of Mercury in Fish by Isotope Dilution Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry,"A method for mild extraction and subsequent determination of total mercury content in fish by isotope dilution inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ID-ICP-MS) has been developed. The errors in the measurement of mercury isotope ratio were discussed. The dead time and mass bias induced by the system of ICP-MS were corrected by the use of lead isotopic certified reference material NIST SRM 981. The established method was validated by determining total mercury content in two certified reference materials, IAEA 436 (Tuna) and NRCC DOLT-3 (Dogfish Liver). The results of total mercury presented in IAEA 436 and DOLT-3 were 4.23 ± 0.06 and 3.33 ± 0.05 mg kg-1, respectively, which were in agreement with the certified values. The extraction method was suitable for the determination of mercury by ID-ICP-MS because the memory effect of mercury in the system could be efficiently eliminated. © 2007 Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences."
2007-01-01,Toxicological and biological effects of nanomaterials,"In this paper, we summarise the most recent findings on the toxicological and biological (including both favourable and adverse) effects of some studied nanomaterials (nanotubes, fullerene, metallofullerenes, their derivatives, and metallic nanoparticles). The dose-dependent, nanosize dependent, nano-structure dependent biological activity in particular nanotoxicity are discussed. Results show that some conventional methodology for assessing the biological activities of bulk materials may not be valid for nanomaterials even though they have the same chemical composition and are in mass basis. Nevertheless, this kind of research is still in its infancy, and many knowledge gaps exist that need to be filled by further studies. On the other hand, we show some intriguing examples that the adverse biological effects of nanomaterials can be reverse-utilised in biomedical fields. For instance, it was found that the 22 nm [Gd@C 82(OH)22]n particles at a very low dose exhibit an anticancer rate of as high as ∼60% in mice. Dose increase of 1 × 10-7 mol/kg results in a 26% increment of anticancer efficiency. These nanoparticles have strong capacity to improve immunity and obstruct tumour invasion towards normal muscle cells but nearly without toxicity in vivo and in vitro. The fullerene derivatives with proper chemical modifications may help realise the dream of tumour chemotherapeutics of high-efficacy and low-toxicity. Copyright © 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."
2007-01-01,What do we know about innovation in nanotechnology? Some propositions about an emerging field between hype and path-dependency,"This contribution formulates a number of propositions about the emergence of novel nanoscience and nanotechnology (N&N). Seeking to complement recent work that aims to define a research agenda and draws on general insights from the innovation literature, this paper aims to synthesize knowledge from innovation-related studies of the N&N field. More specifically, it is suggested that N&N is often misconstrued as either a field of technology or an area of (broadly) converging technologies while evidence to date suggests rather that N&N be considered a set of inter-related and overlapping about not necessarily merging technologies. The role of instrumentation in connecting the various N&N fields is underlined. Finally, the question is raised whether change in N&N tends to be incremental rather than discontinuous, being the result of technological path-dependencies and lock-ins in industry-typical search regimes that are only slowly giving way to more boundary-crossing activities. © 2007 Akadémiai Kiadó."

2006-09-01,"The nano enterprise: A survey of health and safety concerns, considerations, and proposed improvement strategies to reduce potential adverse effects","Nanotechnology is evolving to become a leading industry. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the potential health effects of nanomaterials and its components. This study focuses on the hazards and risks that nanomaterials pose to physical and environmental health together with the risks posed during their manufacture and research. In particular, the authors seek to promote awareness and the need for the adoption of various strategies to minimize the risk of human exposure to nanotechnologies both within and outside the manufacturing enterprise. Information from scientific journals, project studies, environmental and worker-protection agency reports are used as the main source for this study. The six sigma's DMAIC framework, viz. ""define, measure, analyze, improve, and control,"" is used as a guideline for synthesizing information from published literature. Preliminary evidence from experimental research studies indicate the ability of nanomaterials to penetrate and cause damage to human tissues and cells. The susceptibility of the personnel associated during production (those who are more likely to be at risk) has been analyzed to examine considerations and targets, as well as for developing strategies for a continued research framework. Nanotechnology may pose health and environmental hazards unless adequate preventive measures are developed and implemented. Because of the likely unfavorable health effects on individuals conducting experiments and handling nanomaterials, studies that identify the adverse effects of nanotechnology must be conducted at a pace level with the commercialization of nanotechnology. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

After a brief discussion of the appropriateness of an environmental ethics framework for the task at hand, the chapter identifies a representative environmental ethic and uses it to evaluate four salient issues that emerge from nanotechnology. The discussion is intended both to give an initial theoretical take on nanotechnology from the perspective of environmental ethics and to provide a clear indication of the direction from which environmental resistance might come."
2006-01-01,Progress in governance of converging technologies integrated from the nanoscale,"It is expected that convergence of nanotechnology, modern biology, the digital revolution, and cognitive sciences will bring about tremendous improvements in transformative tools, generate new products and services, enable human personal abilities and social achievements, and in time reshape societal relationships. This article focuses on the progress made in governance of such converging, emerging technologies that are integrated with more traditional technologies. The proposed framework for governance calls for several key functions: supporting the transformative impact; advancing responsible development that includes health, safety, and ethical concerns; encouraging national and global partnerships; and commitment to long-term planning with effects on human development. Principles of good governance include participation of all those involved or affected by the new technologies, transparency, participant responsibility, and effective strategic planning. Introduction and management of converging technologies must be done with respect for immediate concerns (such as information technology privacy, access to medical advancements, and addressing toxicity of new nanomaterials) and longer-term concerns (such as human development and concern for human integrity, dignity, and welfare). Four levels of governance of converging technologies have been identified: (a) adapting existing regulations and organizations; (b) establishing new programs, regulations, and organizations specifically to handle converging technologies; (c) national policies and institutional capacity building; and (d) international agreements and partnerships. © 2006 New York Academy of Sciences."
2005-12-12,Military nanotechnology: Potential applications and preventive arms control,"With revolutionary changes in nanotechnology (NT) now on the horizon, many countries have started major research and development (R&D) programmes, which are mainly civilian. Often overlooked are military R&D programmes - in particular those of the US government. This is the first systematic and comprehensive presentation of the potential military applications of NT. In ten to twenty years, these applications may include extremely small computers, robots, missiles, satellites, launchers and sensors. They may also provide lighter and stronger materials for vehicles and weapons, implants in soldiers' bodies, metal-free firearms, autonomous fighting systems, and smaller chemical and biological weapons. These potential uses raise strong concerns. This assessment is made from a viewpoint of international security, considering the new criteria of dangers for arms control and the international law of warfare, dangers for stability through potential new arms races and proliferation, and dangers for humans and society. Some military applications, such as computers, will be so close to civilian uses that limits are impractical. Others, such as sensors for biological-warfare agents, may contribute to stronger protection against terrorist attacks and better verification of compliance with arms-control treaties. For preventive limitation of these new technologies, specific approaches are proposed that balance positive civilian uses and take into account verification of compliance, with a view to international peace and security, not national military strength. This book will be of great interest to scholars of military technology, non-lethal weapons, disarmament and security studies in general."
2005-12-01,Translocation of inhaled TiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles along olfactory nervous system to brain studied by synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence,"Nanosized TiO2 is widely used for cleaning air, antibacterial and decomposing organic in wastewater for its highly photocatalytic function. TiO2 inhalation via respiratory tracts is the most common route of its exposure in industry and environment. After inhalation by human or rodents, TiO2 can induce inflammation and pulmonary lesions, which was reported to even cause lung cancer by long-term exposure. In this paper, Synchrotron Radiation X-ray Fluorescence was employed to investigate the distribution of TiO2 in the olfactory bulb and brain of mice after inhalation of TiO2 particles suspension. The results showed that TiO2 could enter the olfactory nerve layer (ON), granular cell layer of olfactory bulb (Gro), and olfactory ventricle (OV) and further the hippocampus, thalamus, and CA3 area of the brain through the olfactory nervous system. The distribution area of microsized TiO2 was wider than that of nanosized TiO2."
2005-10-01,Status of study on biological and toxicological effects of nanoscale materials,"Because the physical and chemical properties of nanosized materials mostly differ from the existing microsized materials, their potential impacts on human health and the environment will be topics under the serious discussions in press and in a number of international scientific journals. We analyze and summarize the existing data of the experimental study on the biological activities and adverse effects of nanoscale materials/particles including single wall carbon nanotubes, multi wall carbon nanotubes, titanium oxide and iron powders. Though some biological behaviors of nanoscale materials observed cannot be understood on the basis of the current knowledge, as the existing data are mostly preliminary, it is too early to make some exclusive conclusions on biological activities (or the toxicity) of any of nanoscale materials. The experimental techniques, the current topics, and the future research directions for this new research field are also discussed."
